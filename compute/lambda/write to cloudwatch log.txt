  -CloudWatch logs used by Lambda are named "/aws/lambda/[FUNCTION_NAME]", where "[FUNCTION_NAME]" is the Lambda function name
  -It may take 5 to 10 minutes for logs to show up after a function invocation.
  -no additional charge for using Lambda logs; however, standard CloudWatch Logs charges apply
Main Success Scenario:
  1. see code below 

    import os

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        print('## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES')
        print(os.environ)
        print('## EVENT')
        print(event)
