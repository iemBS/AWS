    -https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-handler.html
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Handle One Event Type"
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Handle more than one type of event 
    1a1. "Handle More than One Event Type"
    1a2. Go to step 2
  1b. Handle same event sent directly and via EventBridge
    1b1. Determine if event is needed from both perspectives
    1b2. Block one of the perspectives if only one is needed
    1b3. go to step 2
  1c. Handle event sent directly and exit Glue job successfully to prevent the EventBridge error from being sent
    1c1. see code below
        from pyspark.context import SparkContext
        from awsglue.context import GlueContext
        from awsglue.job import Job
        import os

        Job(GlueContext(SparkContext())).commit()
        os._exit(0)
    1c2. go to step 2


Handle More than One Event Type
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Understand Event Structure" 
  2. "Determine Event Type"
  3. "Parse Event"
      def handler_name(event, context):
        if event['EventType'] == 'helper1':
          helper1(event, context)
        elif event['EventType'] == 'helper2':
          helper2(event, context)

      def helper1(event, context):
        pass

      def helper2(event, context):
        pass
    
    
Handle One Event Type
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Understand Event Structure" 
  2. "Validate Event"
  3. "Parse Event"
  
  
Validate Event
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  2. End
Alternatives:
  1a. Workaround Invalid Event
    1a1. Work around invalid event
    1a2 go to step 2
  1b. CANNOT workaround invalid event
    1b1. xxx:fill in 
  
 
Parse Event
Pre-Condition:
  -"Understand Event Structure"
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Determine Event Type"
  2. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Understand Event Structure
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Understand EventBridge Event Structure"
Alternatives:
  1a. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Understand EventBridge Event

Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  

Determine Event Type
Note:
  -Even if handling one type of event, you want to validate the event
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Validate Event"
  2. xxx:fill in
