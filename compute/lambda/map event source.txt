  -An event source mapping is a Lambda resource that reads from an event source and invokes a Lambda function
  -You can use event source mappings to process items from a stream or queue in services that don't invoke Lambda functions directly
  -services that Lambda platform provides event source mappings for:
    -Amazon DynamoDB
    -Amazon Kinesis
    -Amazon MQ
    -Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)
    -Self-managed Apache Kafka
    -Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)
    -Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) (Amazon DocumentDB)
  -services that invoke lambda functions directly:
    -xxx:fill in 
  -An event source mapping uses permissions in the function's execution role to read and manage items in the event source. 
  -Lambda event source mappings process events at least once due to the distributed nature of its pollers. 
    -Lambda function may receive duplicate events in rare situations
    -Follow Best practices for working with AWS Lambda functions and build idempotent functions to avoid issues related to duplicate events
      -Idemppotent: denoting an element of a set which is unchanged in value when multiplied or otherwise operated on by itself.
  -Event source mappings read items from a target event source
  -Event source mapping batches records together into a single payload that Lambda sends to your function
    -default behavior
  -Batch window (MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds) and a batch size (BatchSize) are configurable
  -Batch window is the maximum amount of time to gather records into a single payload
  -Batch size is the maximum number of records in a single batch
  -Lambda invokes your function when one of the following three criteria is met
    -xxx:Fill in 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in
