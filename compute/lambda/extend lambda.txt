Extend Internally
Note:
  -An internal extension runs as part of the runtime process. Your function accesses internal extensions by using wrapper scripts or in-process mechanisms such as JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS.
  -The runtime environment may be edited for an internal extension. See ref @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-modify.html

Extend Externally
Note:
  -An external extension runs as an independent process in the execution environment and continues to run after the function invocation is fully processed. Because extensions run as separate processes, you can write them in a different language than the function.
  -Lambda runtimes that support external extensions @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html
