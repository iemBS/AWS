  -Lambda functions are run as the execution role
  -For Lambda platform to properly assume the execution role, the role's trust policy must specify the Lambda service principal (lambda.amazonaws.com) as a trusted service.
  -Example way of setting up that trust
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Invoke function
  2. Lambda platform automatically provides function with temp credentials by assuming the execution role.
  3. Function is executed as the execution role
