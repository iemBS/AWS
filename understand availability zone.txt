Understand Availability Zone
Note:
  -An availability zone is
    -Isolated distinct data center in the same region
    -connected via a low latency link
  
  -Secondary host used in multi-az, does not improve performance of your DB instance. That is because the secondary host does not handle active write traffic. The secondary host is used for failover scenarios. Writes to a multi-AZ DB instance are slightly slower. 
  -backup time is improved because they are taking of the passive secondary host rather than of the primary host. 
  -Having a primary and secondary host is twice the cost of the primary alone. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in
