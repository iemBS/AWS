    -JSON spec @ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON
  -Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) uniquely identify AWS resources
  -AWS requires an ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS
  -partition is xxx:fill in
  -service is the service namespace that identifies the AWS product
  -values in the partition part of an ARN
    -Standard AWS regions use "aws"
    -A non-standard one, like China (Beijing) has "aws-cn"
  -values in the service part of an ARN, ref @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html
    -S3: s3
    -IAM: iam
    -Secure Token Service: sts

  -values in the region part of an ARN
    -xxx:fill in
  -values in the account ID part of an ARN
    -xxx:fill in
  -Resources that must include region in the 4th position 
    -xxx:fill in
  -Resources that do not need to include region in the 4th position 
    -xxx:fill in
  -Resources that do not need to include account ID in the 5th position 
    -xxx:fill in
  -example ARN explained
    -
Pre-Conditions:
  -All ARN must include:
    -"arn" prefix
    -partition and in the 2nd position of the arn
    -service and in the 3rd position of the arn
  -Some ARN must include:
    -region in the 4th position of the arn
    -account id in the 5th position of the arn
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Use a format of arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-id
Alternatives:
  1a. Use a format where the ARN includes a resource type 
    1a1. arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id
  1b. Use an alternate format where the ARN includes a resource type
    1b1. arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type:resource-id
  1c. Use a format where the ARN includes a parent resource
    1c1. arn:partition:service:region:account-id:sub-resource-type/parent-resource/sub-resource
  1d. Use a format where the ARN includes a qualifier
    1d1. arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-name:qualifier
  1e. Use a format where the ARN includes an asterisk
    1e1. xxx:fill in
  1f. Use a format where region and account ID are omitted 
    1f1. arn:aws:s3:::resource
