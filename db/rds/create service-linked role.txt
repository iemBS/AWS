  -You don't need to manually create a service-linked role. 
  -When you create a DB instance, Amazon RDS creates the service-linked role for you.
  -Amazon RDS uses the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForRDS to allow Amazon RDS to call AWS services on behalf of your DB instances.
  -The AWSServiceRoleForRDS service-linked role trusts the following services to assume the role:
    -rds.amazonaws.com
  -AWSServiceRoleForRDS service-linked role has a permissions policy attached to it called AmazonRDSServiceRolePolicy. 
    AmazonRDSServiceRolePolicy grants AWSServiceRoleForRDS permissions to operate in your account
