Main Success Scenario:
  1."Choices for Environment Admin"
  2."Choices for DB Admin"
  3."Choices for Developer"

Choices for Environment Admin
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Make larger time reservation commitment in advance
  2. Reserve instead of on-demand 
  3. Minimize auto back up (drive space)
  4. use public instead of private subnets
  5. Just use default VPC (CPU, drive space)
  6. Minimize # of read replicas (drive space)
  7. Remove deletion protection
  
Choices for DB Admin
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Minimize logging (drive space)
  2. Choose lower cost destination during data transfer
  3. Minimize manual snapshot (drive space)
  4. Minimize backtracking (drive space)
  
Choices for Developer
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/using-explain.html
Main Success Scenario:
  . Have only what is needed
  . Understand syntax of query language 
  . Use EXPLAIN command to see query execution plan
  . "Put Working Data Set in RAM"
  . "Minimize data transfer frequency"
  . "Minimize Table Scanning"
   
Put Working Data Set in RAM
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.BestPractices.html
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Use "VolumeReadIOPS" metric to see if you are reading or writing to a disk too much
  2. Use "BufferCacheHitRatio" metric to see if you are reading from the buffer cache of a DB instance or from a disk
  
Minimize Table Scanning
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Add indexing for joins
  2. Add indexing for filters
