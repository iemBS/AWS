Use Reader Endpoint
Pre-Conditions:
  -The reader endpoint load-balances connections to available Aurora Replicas in an Aurora DB cluster. It doesn't load-balance individual queries. If you want to load-balance each query to distribute the read workload for a DB cluster, open a new connection to the reader endpoint for each query.
Note:

    -https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.Endpoints.html
  -Example of a regular cluster endpoint
    mydbcluster.cluster-123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306
  -If your cluster contains only a primary instance and no Aurora Replicas, the reader endpoint connects to the primary instance. In that case, you can perform write operations through this endpoint.
  -Each Aurora cluster has a single built-in reader endpoint, whose name and other attributes are managed by Aurora. You can't create, delete, or modify this kind of endpoint.
  -The lag in Aurora replication is usually much less than 100 milliseconds after the primary instance has written an update. Noted @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Replication.html
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Get the read-only endpoint below (name differs from the regular one)
    mydbcluster.cluster-ro-123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306
  2. Specify the use of this alternate end point in a connection string used by client software (Excel, MySQL Workbench, etc)
  3. End
Alternatives:
  1a. Use Custom End Point instead
    1a1. xxx:fill in
