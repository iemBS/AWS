  -"Log Level" preference setting in MySQL Workbench client @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-preferences-others.html
  -RESIGNAL statement allows you to re-throw an error that came from your current procedure or from a child procedure. 
  -Default behavior of MySQL is to bubble up an error unless it is handled with an EXIT HANDLER or CONTINUE HANDLER. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Error from Server"
  2. "Bubble error up in SQL code"
  3. "Send Error to Error Log"
Alternatives:
  1a. Error from Client Program instead
    1a1. "Error from Client Program"
  3a. Send Error to Client Program instead
    3a1. "Send Error to Client Program"
    
  
Error from Client Program
Note:
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/5.7/en/client-error-reference.html
  -Client error messages originate from within the MySQL client library.
  -For client-side errors, the SQLSTATE value is always 'HY000' (general error), so it is not meaningful for distinguishing one client error from another.
    -The MySQL Error # will need to be relied upon instead
  -In addition to the errors in the following list, the client library can also produce error messages that have error codes in the range from 1 to 999.

Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in
  
Error from Server
Note:
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/5.7/en/server-error-reference.html
  -For server-side errors, not all MySQL error numbers have corresponding SQLSTATE values. In these cases, 'HY000' (general error) is used.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in
  
Send Error to Error Log
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in

Send Error to Client Program
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in

Bubble error up in SQL code
Main Success Scenario:
  1. SQL code has autocommit set to "ON" and no explicit transaction
  2. xxx:fill in
Alternatives:
  1a. SQL code has autocommit set to "OFF" and no explicit transaction
    1a1. xxx:fill in
  1b. SQL code has autocommit set to "ON" and explicit transaction specified
