  -During implicit rollbacks, as well as during the execution of an explicit ROLLBACK SQL statement, SHOW PROCESSLIST displays Rolling back in the State column for the relevant connection.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. On a duplicate key error, only the statement is rolled back
Alternatives:
  1a.If an inserted row is too large, only the statement is rolled back
  1b. If you run out of disk space, only the statement is rolled back
  1c. If a deadlock occurs, the entire transaction is rolled-back
  1d. If a lock wait takes too long, the behaviour depends on it depends on the setting of innodb-rollback-on-timeout.
  1e. If the server stops or crashes before a commit (or before a statement run in autocommit completes), the entire transaction is rolled-back when the server starts up again.
