Set System Variable Value
Note:
  -System variables exist at the DB Cluster and Instance (of a DB Cluster) level
  -List of System variables at the DB Custer and Instance level @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Reference.html#AuroraMySQL.Reference.Parameters.Instance
Pre-Conditions:
  -Global scope of system variables cannot be set in a SQL window like the following. You need to set it in the RDS UI or using CLI. 
    Set @@Global.MySysVar = 'value'
  -Session scope of system variables can be set in a SQL window like the following:
    Set @@Session.MySysVar = 'value'
  -You can set DB Cluster and Instance level system variables 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. In the AWS GUI, go to RDS > Databases > [specific database] > Configuration > [DB cluster parameter group]
  2. See columns 
       "Modifiable" columnn lets you know if you can change the system variable
       "Apply Type" column lets you know if you can change it while the DB is running
       "Name" is the name of the system variable 
       "Value" is the current value regardless if you can see it when you run Select MySysVar in a SQL client
  3. Filter on the system variable you want to change
  4. Check the box on the left and click the "Edit Parameters" button
  5. Change the value in the "Value" column and click the "Save Parameters" button. (button may not show as clicked after clicking)
  6. Wait till you can see the new value when you run "select MySysVar" in your MySQL client
