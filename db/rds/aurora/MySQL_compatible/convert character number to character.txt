Convert Character Set Hex Number to Character
Note:
  -Guidance for using character set introducer @ https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/mysql-g11n-excerpt-8.0-en.pdf
  -"X" indicates that the source number is a hex number
  -A unicode hex number of 0x01 would be written as X'01'
  -The _[character set] is an introducer that indicates what character set the hex number is from
  -Character sets availabe in MySQL @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-mysql.html
Main Success Scenario:
  1. SELECT _utf8mb4 X'01' # from Unicode Hex Number
Alternatives:
  1a. Convert from CP1252 Hex Number
    1a1. SELECT _latin1 X'01' 
  1b. Convert from a decimal or hexadecimal number for a charater set to a character 
    1b1. See query below 

    SELECT 
      _utf8 X'3B' As semicolon, # Convert a Unicode hexadecimal number of 0x3B to a character
        CAST(_utf8 X'3B' As Char(1)) As semicolon2, # Convert a Unicode hexadecimal number of 0x3B to a character
        CAST(CHAR(59) As Char(1)) As semicolon3, # Convert a decimal number between 1 and 127 of the ASCII character set to a character
      CAST(UNHEX('3B') As Char(1)) As semicolon4, # Convert a hexadecimal number of the [XXX:fill in] character set to a character
        _utf8mb4 X'3B' as semicolon5, # Convert a Unicode hexadecimal number of 0x3B to a character
        _latin1 X'3B' as semicolon6, # Convert a CP1252 hexadecimal number of 0x3B to a character
        Concat('a',_utf8 X'3B','b') As semicolonInString # Convert a Unicode hexadecimal number of 0x3B to a character within a string
