See Where Current User is not Invoker
Note:
  -guidance @
    -https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-view.html
  -The CURRENT_USER function returns the view's DEFINER value by default. For views defined with the SQL SECURITY INVOKER characteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the account for the view's invoker.
  -The USER column in the information_schema.tables view works the same as the CURRENT_USER function. 
  -Having the "SQL SECURITY INVOKER"  at the head of a proc, function, or view definition allows you to see who is really running that sql object. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See what views, procs, and functions have current user as definer instead of invoker
