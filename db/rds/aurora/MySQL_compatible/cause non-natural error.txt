Cause Non-Natural Error
Note:
  -Range of SQLSTATE values that can be used by developers, not used by MySQL, and are allowed by MySQL
  -Full list of natural SQLSTATE and MySQL Error # @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/5.7/en/ix01.html
  -"HY000" SQLSTATE is the same thing as the "45000" SQLSTATE
  -MESSAGE_TEXT condition of SIGNAL statement limited to 128 characters. Ref @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/signal.html#signal-condition-information-items
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Throw custom unhandled error
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
       SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'my custom message',
           MYSQL_ERRNO = xxx:fill in
  2. End
Alternatives:
  1a. Use SQLSTATE value that is not used by MySQL, but allowed
    1a1. See code below
      SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45002'
    1a2. Returns the default MESSAGE_TEXT and MySQL Error #
      "Unhandled user-defined exception condition"
      1644
    1a3. Go to Step 2
  1b. Use a SQLSTATE value that is not used by MySQL (but allowed) and use a MySQL Error # that is used by MySQL
    1b1. SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45001' SET MYSQL_ERRNO = 2060;
    1b2. Returns the default MESSAGE_TEXT for SQLSTATE 45000 and MySQL Error #
      "Unhandled user-defined exception condition"
      2060
  1c. Throw an error with a known SQLSTATE and MySQL Error # combination that requires input from the query
    1c1. SIGNAL SQLSTATE 'HY000' SET MYSQL_ERRNO = 1233;
    1c2. Returns a MESSAGE_TEXT and MySQL Error # of
      "Unhandled user-defined exception condition"
      1233
  1d. Use MYSQL_ERRNO value that is not used by MySQL, but allowed
    1d1. xxx:fill in
  1e. Do a change that causes a natural error to occur
    1e1. "Cause Natural Error using Non-Natural Means"
  1f. Set max_allowed_packet system variable to a value less than the size of the IN operator can handle 
    1f1. Set @@session.max_allowed_packet = 1024
    1f2. Returns a MESSAGE_TEXT and MySQL Error # of xxx
