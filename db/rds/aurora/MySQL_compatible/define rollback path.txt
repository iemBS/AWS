Define Rollback Path
Pre-Conditions:
  -This defines the path the rollback takes and is not concerned with how the rollback is started or caused
Main Success Scenario:
  1. 
Alternatives:
  1a. Program calling MySQL only returns the MySQL Error # and MESSAGE_TEXT
    1a1. "Collect Info in SQL code"  
    
    
Collect Info in SQL code
Pre-Conditions:
  -The calling program will know the DB and SQL Object names when they are called directly by that program. So, no need to collect that info within the SQL code.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. SQL Code is called directly by the Program
    -Collect part of query that is reached during execution (these are labels within the query)
  2. Return the collected info when the SQL code execution completes
Alternatives:
  1a. SQL Code is in a nested SQL object (procedure, function, trigger)
    1a1. Collect name of DB that current SQL object is in
    1a2. Collect name of current SQL object (procedure, function, trigger, event, or script name)
    1a3. Collect part of query that is reached during execution (these are labels within the query)
    1a4. Go to Step 2.
