  -Guidance @ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22167132/mysql-like-query-with-underscore
  -Underscore characters need to be escaped if searched for in a value
  -When searching for partial strings in MySQL with LIKE you will match case-insensitive by default. If you want to match case-sensitive, you can cast the value as binary and then do a byte-by-byte comparision vs. a character-by-character comparision. The only thing you need to add to your query is BINARY.
