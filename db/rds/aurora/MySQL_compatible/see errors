  -SHOW ERRORS is a diagnostic statement that is similar to SHOW WARNINGS, except that it displays information only for errors, rather than for errors, warnings, and notes.
  -SELECT @@error_count will clear the message list in "SHOW ERRORS" if run. 
  -SHOW COUNT(*) ERRORS will NOT clear the message list in "SHOW ERRORS" if run. 
  -The max_error_count system variable controls the maximum number of error, warning, and note messages for which the server stores information
Main Success Scenario:
  1. SHOW ERRORS; 
  2. END
Alternatives:
  1a. Get count of warnings 
    1a1. SHOW COUNT(*) ERRORS;
    1a2. END
  1b. Get count of warnings via the system variable
    1b1. SELECT @@error_count;
    1b2. END
  1c. Errors gone since max_error_count was exceeded
    1c1. The oldest warning, error, and note messages in SHOW WARNINGS have been pushed out to limit to the number of messages in max_error_count
    1c2. END
