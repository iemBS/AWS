Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/show-errors.html
  -SHOW ERRORS is a diagnostic statement that is similar to SHOW WARNINGS, except that it displays information only for errors, rather than for errors, warnings, and notes.
  -SELECT @@error_count will clear the message list in "SHOW ERRORS" if run. 
  -SHOW COUNT(*) ERRORS will NOT clear the message list in "SHOW ERRORS" if run. 
  -The max_error_count system variable controls the maximum number of error, warning, and note messages for which the server stores information
  -"error_count" is only a session variable 
  -The global and session scopes of the max_error_count variable can be changed to a value of 65535. 
    -See doc @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_error_count
  -The max_error_count variable can bet set within Aurora serverless using a query like below for the session scope, but not for the global scope. The setting of the global scope variable gives an "Error Code: 1227. Access denied; you need (at least one of) the SUPER privilege(s) for this operation" error. 
    -SET SESSION max_error_count = 67; 
  -According to the following AWS doc, The global scope of the max_error_count variable cannot be changed in the RDS console either.

  -SHOW ERRORS shows the errors only for the latest statement. 
  -SHOW ERRORS gets its messages from the Diagnostic Area

Question:
  -What kind of errors are seen with these @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/communication-errors.html
  -Do errors get shown only in the console if running from the console intead of also showing in the Error log? See ref to stderr @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/error-log-syslog.html
Main Success Scenario:
  1. SHOW ERRORS; 
  2. END
Alternatives:
  1a. Get count of warnings 
    1a1. SHOW COUNT(*) ERRORS;
    1a2. END
  1b. Get count of warnings via the system variable
    1b1. SELECT @@Session.error_count;
    1b2. END
  1c. Errors gone since max_error_count was exceeded
    1c1. The oldest warning, error, and note messages in SHOW WARNINGS have been pushed out to limit to the number of messages in max_error_count
    1c2. END
  1d. Find permissions related errors
    1d1. Search for "access denied" and "command denied" text in error messages
