Insert Into Index
Note:
  -Unique and non-unique indexes have their own table and sorting will be done in that table.
  -Primary indexes do not have their own table and the sorting is done in the same table.
  -When a table with an index is inserted into, the index is also inserted into. 
    -For a non-primary key, that is unique or non-unique, the values inserted into the index are sorted during insert
    -For a primary key, the table is sorted during insert
  -When a table with an index is updated, the index is also updated if the updated columns are in the index
    -For a non-primary key, that is unique or non-unique, the values inserted into the index are sorted after being updated
    -For a primary key, the table is updated during insert
