Degrade Index
Note: 
  -Doing soft deletes and then moving those to another table when possible, is a controlled and flexible way to handle hard deletes and update indexing. 
  -Update of values in columns that do not contribute to the index, do not make a difference. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Delete large number of rows from a table with variable-length rows (that is, having VARCHAR, BLOB, or TEXT columns)
  2. Truncate several times a table with variable-length rows (that is, having VARCHAR, BLOB, or TEXT columns)
  3. Truncate a large table with variable-length rows (that is, having VARCHAR, BLOB, or TEXT columns)
  3. Make several value updates to variable length (that is, having VARCHAR, BLOB, or TEXT) columns within the index
