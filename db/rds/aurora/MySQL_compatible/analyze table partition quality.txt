Analyze Table Partition Quality
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-maintenance.html
    -If you have deleted a large number of rows from a partition or if you have made many changes to a partitioned table with variable-length rows (that is, having VARCHAR, BLOB, or TEXT columns), you can use ALTER TABLE ... OPTIMIZE PARTITION to reclaim any unused space and to defragment the partition data file.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in
  2. See how well the data is distributed across the partitions
  
    SELECT 
        PARTITION_ORDINAL_POSITION, 
        TABLE_ROWS, 
        PARTITION_METHOD
    FROM 
      information_schema.PARTITIONS 
    WHERE 
      TABLE_SCHEMA = 'db_name' 
        AND 
        TABLE_NAME = 'tbl_name';
        
3. See count of rows for each combination of RowCurrentInd, SourceSystemId (If bad, may want to push RowCurrentInd = 0 to another table)
4. See percent of current rows where ActionId = 3 (If high, may want to push ActionId = 3 to another table)
x. xxx:fill in
