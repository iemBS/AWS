Get Current Read and Write Transaction Count
Note:
  -Read-only transactions do not exist in the INNODB_TRX view and are not assigned a transaction ID
    -The lack of a transaction ID for read-only transactions is because there is enough overhead in it
Main Success Scenario:
  1. SELECT count(*) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TRX
