Calculate Concurrent Transaction Limit
Note:

Main Success Scenario:
  1. Each transaction performs either an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE , the 
    # of concurrent read-write transactions InnoDB is capable of supporting  = (innodb_page_size / 16) * (innodb_rollback_segments - 32)
Alternatives:
  1a. Each transaction performs an INSERT and an UPDATE or DELETE
    1a1. # of concurrent read-write transactions InnoDB is capable of supporting  = innodb_page_size / 16 / 2) * (innodb_rollback_segments - 32)
  1b. Each transaction performs an INSERT operation on a temporary table
    1b1. # of concurrent read-write transactions InnoDB is capable of supporting  = (innodb_page_size / 16) * 32
  1c. Each transaction performs an INSERT and an UPDATE or DELETE operation on a temporary table
    1c1. # of concurrent read-write transactions InnoDB is capable of supporting  = innodb_page_size / 16 / 2) * 32
  1d. Max limit of concurrent transactions
