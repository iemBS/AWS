Estimate Insert Time
Pre-Conditions:
  -This does not take into consideration the initial overhead to open tables, which is done once for each concurrently running query.
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert-optimization.html
  -This does not take into consideration the initial overhead to open tables, which is done once for each concurrently running query.
  -The size of the table slows down the insertion of indexes by log N, assuming B-tree indexes.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. The time required for inserting a row is determined by the following factors, where the numbers indicate approximate proportions:
  
        Connecting: (3)
        Sending query to server: (2)
        Parsing query: (2)
        Inserting row: (1 × size of row)
        Inserting indexes: (1 × number of indexes)
        Closing: (1)
