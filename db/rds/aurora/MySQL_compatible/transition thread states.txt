  -threads may also be called connections or processes here
  -thread types
    -general
    -query cache: associated with the query cache
    -Binlog Dump: On the replication source. If you see no Binlog Dump threads on a source, this means that replication is not running; that is, that no replicas are currently connected.
    -Event Scheduler: Threads that are created to execute scheduled events, or threads that terminate the scheduler.
  -foreground threads
    -xxx
  -background threads
    -xxx
  -"starting" is the first state at the beginning of statement execution.
  -thread command
    -Binlog Dump: This is a thread on a replication source for sending binary log contents to a replica.
    -Change user: The thread is executing a change user operation.
    -Close stmt: The thread is closing a prepared statement.
    -Connect: A replica is connected to its source.
    -Connect Out: A replica is connecting to its source.
    -Create DB: The thread is executing a create database operation.
    -Daemon: This thread is internal to the server, not a thread that services a client connection.
    -Debug: The thread is generating debugging information.

    -Query: The thread is executing a statement.
    -Quit: The thread is terminating.
    -Refresh: The thread is flushing table, logs, or caches, or resetting status variable or replication server information.
    -Register Slave: The thread is registering a replica server.
    -Reset stmt: The thread is resetting a prepared statement.

Main Succes Scenario:
  1. "Transition from 'cleaning up' to 'cleaned up'"
Alternatives:
  1a. "Transition from 'cleaned up' to 'xxx'"
  1b. "Transition from 'freeing items' to 'cleaning up'"
  1c. "Transition from 'query end' to 'freeing items'"
  
  
Transition from 'cleaning up' to 'cleaned up'
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Show "cleaning up" state for XXX seconds
  2. Show "cleaned up" state 
  
  
Transition from 'query end' to 'freeing items'
Note:
  -"query end" state occurs after processing a query 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Transition from 'cleaned up' to 'xxx'
Note:
  -
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Transition from 'freeing items' to 'cleaning up'
Note:
  -Some freeing of items done during the "freeing items" state involves the query cache
Main Success Scenario:
  1.
