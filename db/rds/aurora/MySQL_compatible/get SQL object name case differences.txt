Get SQL Object Name Case Differences
Note: 
  -Use your knowledge of the case you want to use to limit the list of bad cases you have to deal with
Main Success Scenario:
  x. Establish what case you want to use (Pascal Case, Camel Case, or something else)
  x. Compare table names of two DBs that have the same table name spellings
