  -SELECTs use an index, but UPDATEs do not
  -Using a composite index where you are filtering on the first two columns, but not the third column, may still provide query optimization
    -Adding a simple filter like Col3 > 0, Length(Col3) > 0, or Col3 Is Not Null may cause MySQL to use the composite index
  -Use the EXPLAIN command to see if a index is used
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Select * From MyTbl
     Use Index(idx_MyTbl)
     Where Col2 = 3
  2. End
Alternatives:
  1a. Hint more than one index
    1a1. xxx:fill in 
  1b. Force an index to be used
    1b1. xxx:fill in 
  1c. Use more columns of an index in the where clause to encourage the use of of an index, instead of using an index hint
    1c1. Index is a composite index of Col1, Col2, and Col3 and in that order
    1c2. Already filtering on Col1 and Col2 in query, but index not used by MySQL
    1c3. Add a simple filter on Col3 to encourage the index to be used
    1c4. Select * From MyTbl Where Col1 = 27 And Col2 = 3 And Col3 > 0
    1c5. Go to step 2
