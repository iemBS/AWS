  -https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/event-scheduler.html
  -https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-triggers/working-mysql-scheduled-event/
  -If the event scheduler is not enabled, you can set the event_scheduler system variable to enable and start it.

  -MySQL Events are also known as “temporal triggers” because they are triggered by time, not by DML events like normal triggers. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See code below 
  
    CREATE EVENT myevent
    ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 HOUR
    DO
      UPDATE myschema.mytable SET mycol = mycol + 1;
     
  2. xxx:fill in
  
Alternatives:
  1a. Keep event from disappearing after schedule is complete
    1a1. See code below

      CREATE EVENT myevent
      ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 HOUR 
      ON COMPLETION PRESERVE
      DO
        UPDATE myschema.mytable SET mycol = mycol + 1;
        
    1a2. Go to step 2
    
  1b. Be expecit about event going away after the schedule is complete
    1b1. See code below
    
      CREATE EVENT myevent
      ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 HOUR 
      ON COMPLETION NOT PRESERVE
      DO
        UPDATE myschema.mytable SET mycol = mycol + 1;
      
    1b2. Go to step 2
