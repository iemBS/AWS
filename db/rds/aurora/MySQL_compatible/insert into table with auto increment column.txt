Insert Into Table with Auto Increment Column
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-tutorial-excerpt/5.7/en/example-auto-increment.html
  -When you insert any other value into an AUTO_INCREMENT column, the column is set to that value and the sequence is reset so that the next automatically generated value follows sequentially from the largest column value.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See query below 
      Insert Into MyTbl
        (n)
      select 
        @seq :=floor(@seq + 1) AS n
      from 
        (select @seq :=0)s, information_schema.columns 
Alternatives:
  1a. Insert value into column specified as auto increment 
    1a1. insert value into column and the next auto increment value will be the value after the highest value in the column
        xxx:fill in
