Rank Values
Note:
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-window-functions/mysql-rank-function/
Pre-Conditions:
  -Must be using MySQL 8.0 or higher to use the RANK() function
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Ranking in order to collapse the rows into fewer rows. Works if there are enough NULL cells to reduce row count.
    [take the max of the values in columns that are not being grouped on]
  2. Then get the distinct rows in those values
  3. End
Alternatives:
  1a. Do IFNULL then blank & Distinct 
    1a1. xxx:fill in
  1b. Do simple rank of all rows in table/view with variables and compare current to previous
    1b1. "Rank with Method 2"
  1c. Do simple rank with a group by with variables and compare current to previous
    1c2. "Rank with Method 3"
    
    
Rank with Method 2
Note:
  -Simple rank of all rows in table/view
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See code below
    SET @current_schema:=NULL;
    SET @schema_rank:=0;

    select
      schema_name,
        schema_rank
    from
      (
        select 
          schema_name,
          @schema_rank := IF(@current_schema <> schema_name, @schema_rank + 1, 1) AS schema_rank,
          @current_schema := schema_name 
        from
          information_schema.schemata
        order by
          schema_name # determines rank order
        ) rank;
  2. End
  
  
Rank with Method 3
Note:
  -Simple rank for each group by
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See code below
    SET @current_schema:=NULL;
    SET @current_table:=NULL;
    SET @table_rank:=0;

    select
      table_schema,
        table_name,
        table_rank
    from
      (
        select 
          table_schema,
                table_name,
          @table_rank := IF(@current_schema <> table_schema,1,IF(@current_table <> table_name, @table_rank + 1, 1)) AS table_rank,
                @current_schema := table_schema,
          @current_table := table_name 
        from
          information_schema.tables
        order by
          table_schema, # determines separate ranking
                table_name # determines rank order
        ) rank;
  2. End
