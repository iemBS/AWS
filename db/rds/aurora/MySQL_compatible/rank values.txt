Note:
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-window-functions/mysql-rank-function/
Pre-Conditions:
  -Must be using MySQL 8.0 or higher to use the RANK() function
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Ranking in order to collapse the rows into fewer rows. Works if there are enough NULL cells to reduce row count.
    [take the max of the values in columns that are not being grouped on]
  2. Then get the distinct rows in those values
Alternatives:
  1a. Do IFNULL then blank & Distinct 
    1a1. xxx:fill in
