Get Current Session VPN Host
Note:
  -When your MySQL client uses a VPN connect to connect to MySQL, MySQL sees a different host than the one that you see in the @@hostname variable. That is because it sees only the host provided by the VPN and not the one where you are running the MySQL client.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See query below
  
    Select
      Host 
    From
      Information_Schema.ProcessList
    Where 
      ID = CONNECTION_ID()
