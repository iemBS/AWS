Note:
  -Loop must be done in a routine
  -While loop must also be done in a routine

Main Success Scenario:
  1. See query below 
    Set @EndTm = (SELECT DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 5 SECOND));

    WaitLoop:  LOOP
      IF  NOW() > @EndTm THEN 
        LEAVE  WaitLoop;
      END  IF;
          ITERATE  WaitLoop;
    END LOOP;
Alternatives:
  1a. Use WHILE loop instead
    1a1. See query below
    
    WHILE (SELECT Count(ID) FROM Information_Schema.ProcessList Where USER = 'ckent') > 0 DO
      Select 'still in while loop'
    END WHILE;
    
  1b. Use WHILE loop and exist with LEAVE
    1b1. xxx:fill in
  1c. Go to head of WHILE loop 
    1c1. See code below, where "MyLoop" is my loop label
      ITERATE MyLoop
  1d. Loop without a loop construct
    1d1. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32367957/loop-n-times-without-using-a-stored-procedure
