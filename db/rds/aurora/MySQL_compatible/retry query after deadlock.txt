  -Using a continue handler in a procedure to handle a deadlock is not sufficient, because it will not retry the code that threw the deadlock error. It will just continue executing the code after where the deadlock occurred. 
  -You need to catch the deadlock error in a catch of a try catch or in a continue handler. Where you catch it, you need to record the error occurred, wait for a time, possibly check other attributes, and then retry the query. 
  -To prevent an infinite loop, you need to have a check when the error is caught to see if a retry should be done.
