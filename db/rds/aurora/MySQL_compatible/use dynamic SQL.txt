Use Dynamic SQL
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/prepare.html
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/sql-prepared-statements.html
      -SQL syntax for prepared statements does not support multi-statements (that is, multiple statements within a single string separated by ; characters).
  -Guidance @ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/190776/how-to-have-dynamic-sql-in-mysql-stored-procedure
  -USE statement CANNOT be used inside a procedure. See @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-procedure.html
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in
Alternatives:
  1a. Use CONCAT function instead
    1a1. See code below
    
        mysql> USE test;
        mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT NOT NULL);
        mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (4), (8), (11), (32), (80);

        mysql> SET @table = 't1';
        mysql> SET @s = CONCAT('SELECT * FROM ', @table);

        mysql> PREPARE stmt3 FROM @s;
        mysql> EXECUTE stmt3;
        mysql> DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt3;
  1b. Want to have more than one statement that ends with semi-colon
    1b1. Have more than one prepared statement because more than one is not allowed in a prepared statement 
  1c. Want to drop a temp table outside of prepared statement, create temp table inside prepared statement, and use it outside prepared statement
    1c1. See query below
    
      DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS Temp_MyTbl;
      SET @qry = 'CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE Temp_MyTbl SELECT 1 As MyCol';
      PREPARE stmt FROM @qry;
        EXECUTE stmt;
        deallocate prepare stmt;

        Select * From Temp_MyTbl;
