Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Have at least one letter in value"
  2. xxx:fill
  
Have at least one Letter in value
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Select * From MyTbl Where MyCol RegExp '[A-Za-z]+'
  
Find term at start, middle, or end of string
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Get TERM to search for
  2. Return Col1 values where a term is at the start, middle, or end of a string and term is separated from the rest of the string by at least one space
    Select
      *
    From
      TableA
    Where
      Col1 regexp "^TERM .+|.+ TERM .+|.+ TERM$";
  
Have at least one number in value 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Select * From MyTbl Where MyCol RegExp '[0-9]+'
  
Have a character other than a number
Note:
  -The NOT allows you to let in an empty string
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Select * From MyTbl Where MyCol RegExp '[^0-9]'
Alternatives:
  1a. Get a character other than those between 0 and 9 or an empty string
    1a1. Select * From MyTbl Where MyCol NOT RegExp '^[0-9]+$'
  
Have text within value
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Select * From MyTbl Where MyCol RegExp 'cheese'  # returns rows where "cheese" is within the value
  
Get value with exactly 10 characters
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Select * From MyTbl Where MyCol RegExp '^.{10}$'
Alternatives:
  1a. Only 10 characters within the 0 to 9 range of characters
    1a1. Select * From MyTbl Where MyCol RegExp '^[0-9]{10}$'
  1b. Only 10 characters within the 0x70 to 0x74 range of characters in Ascii using hexadecimal numbers for the characters.
    1b1. Select * From MyTbl Where MyCol RegExp '^[\x70-\x74]{10}$'
    
Get a non-empty contiguous string of digits
Main Success Scenario: 
  1. Select * From MyTbl Where MyCol RegExp '^[0-9]+$'
  
Get anything that is not a non-empty contiguous string of digits
Main Success Scenario: 
  1. Select * From MyTbl Where MyCol NOT RegExp '^[0-9]+$'
  
Get Column Values with Invalid Characters
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Return Col1 values that have a character other than dash, a letter, period, space, apostrophe, and comma
      Select
        *
      From
        TableA
      Where
        Col1 regexp "^.*[^\-a-zA-Z\. ',]+.*$"

Have values that start with "a"
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Select * From MyTbl Where MyCol RegExp '^a'
  
Have values that end with "a"
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Select * From MyTbl Where MyCol RegExp 'a$'

See if a quoted identifier would need to be used for this SQL object name
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/identifiers.html
    -characters for SQL object name that does not need a quoted identifier are limited to 
        ASCII: [0-9,a-z,A-Z$_] (basic Latin letters, digits 0-9, dollar, underscore)
        Extended: U+0080 .. U+FFFF
  -MySQL 8.0 and above are the only versions that can search for Unicode characters using the unicode hex numbers. 
    -https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25727830/searching-by-unicode-range-in-mysql
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Select 
        * 
     From 
       MyTbl 
     Where 
       MyCol RegExp '[^0-9,a-z,A-Z$_]'
       #And
       #MyCol RegExp REGEXP '[^\\u0080-\\uFFFF]'  # Filter will not work before MySQL 8.0. Characters in the U+0080 to U+FFFF range are allowed in a SQL object name, but we are unlikely to use them.


Test Regex Logic
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See code below
  
    Select
    Case 
      When 'a' RegExp '[^0-9,a-z,A-Z$_]' then 1
      Else 2
    End
