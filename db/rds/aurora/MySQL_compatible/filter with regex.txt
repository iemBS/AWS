See if a quoted identifier would need to be used for this SQL object name
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/identifiers.html
    -characters for SQL object name that does not need a quoted identifier are limited to 
        ASCII: [0-9,a-z,A-Z$_] (basic Latin letters, digits 0-9, dollar, underscore)
        Extended: U+0080 .. U+FFFF
  -MySQL 8.0 and above are the only versions that can search for Unicode characters using the unicode hex numbers.

Main Success Scenario:
  1. Select 
        * 
     From 
       MyTbl 
     Where 
       MyCol RegExp '[^0-9,a-z,A-Z$_]'
       #And
       #MyCol RegExp REGEXP '[^\\u0080-\\uFFFF]'  # Filter will not work before MySQL 8.0. Characters in the U+0080 to U+FFFF range are allowed in a SQL object name, but we are unlikely to use them.
