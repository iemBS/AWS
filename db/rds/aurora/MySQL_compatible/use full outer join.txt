Use Full Outer Join
Note:
  -A full outer join does not exist in MySQL like it does SQL Server. It can be mimiced though. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See query below

      SELECT * FROM t1
      LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
      UNION
      SELECT * FROM t1
      RIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
      
Alternatives:
  1a. Use UNION ALL instead of UNION
    1a1. See query below
    
      SELECT * FROM t1
      LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
      UNION ALL
      SELECT * FROM t1
      RIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
      WHERE t1.id IS NULL
