Filter with IN operator and Subqeury
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_in
  -Guidance @ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1532366/mysql-number-of-items-within-in-clause
  -The max number of values allowed in the IN list is limited by the max_allowed_packet system variable.
  -The max_allowed_packet system variable is defined @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_allowed_packet
  -Run the following SQL to see the value of the max_allowed_packet system variable globally and per session:
    SELECT @@GLOBAL.max_allowed_packet;
    SELECT @@SESSION.max_allowed_packet;
  -Min and Max values allowed for max_allowed_packet are 1024 Bytes (equal to 1 MB) and 1073741824 Bytes (equal to 1 GB)
  -The documented default for max_allowed_packet is 4194304 Bytes (equal to 4 MB)
  -MySQL will convert the values in an IN list to binary and sort them. 
  -Are values in the column looking in the list of IN values or is the list of IN values searched for in the column?
