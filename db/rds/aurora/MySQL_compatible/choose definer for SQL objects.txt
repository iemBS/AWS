Choose Definer for SQL objects
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/create-procedure.html
    -"DEFINER" defines the security context of a procedure 
    -The "DEFINER" clause specifies the MySQL account to be used when checking access privileges at procedure execution time for procedures that have the "SQL SECURITY DEFINER" characteristic.
    -Within the body of a procedure that is defined with the "SQL SECURITY DEFINER" characteristic, the CURRENT_USER function returns the procedures's DEFINER value.
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/stored-objects-security.html#stored-objects-security-definer
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/stored-objects-security.html#stored-objects-security-sql-security
    -For stored procedures and views, the object definition can include a SQL SECURITY characteristic with a value of DEFINER or INVOKER to specify whether the object executes in definer or invoker context. If the definition omits the SQL SECURITY characteristic, the default is definer context.
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/stored-objects-security.html#stored-objects-security-orphan-objects
    -An object can be orphaned if the account that creates it no longer exists or is an account that never existed
  -Leaving definer as "admin" avoids orphaning SQL objects.
  -Definers are not used for tables and indexes on tables
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/show-processlist.html
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Understand the Users for a procedure 
  
    # STEP 1: Run the procedure create as the admin account
    Drop Procedure If Exists MyTestProcedure;
    DELIMITER $$
    CREATE DEFINER=`admin`@`%` PROCEDURE MyTestProcedure()
    BEGIN

      Drop Table If Exists MyTest;
      Create Table MyTest(
        current_userParensVal varchar(50),
        current_userVal varchar(50),
        system_userParensVal varchar(50),
        userParensVal varchar(50),
        session_userParensVal varchar(50)
      );

      Insert Into 
        MyTest
      SELECT 
        # Returns the DEFINER on the procedure if the 
        current_user() As current_userParensVal, 
            # Returns the DEFINER on the procedure
        current_user AS current_userVal, 
            # Version wo parens does not exist. 
            # This is the server login that was used to access the server.
            # Same as "User" column in SHOW PROCESSLIST (= "Information_Schema.ProcessList" table)
        system_user() As system_userParensVal, 
            # Version wo parens does not exist. 
            # This is the current user name and host name for the MySQL connection.
        user() As userParensVal, 
            # Version wo parens does not exist 
        session_user() As session_userParensVal; 

      Select * From MyTest;
      
    END$$
    DELIMITER ;
    

    # STEP 2: Execute procedure with an account other than the admin account
    CALL MyTestProcedure();
