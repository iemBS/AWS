Get Current Read and Write Transaction ID
Note
  -INNODB_TRX view only contains read and write transactions. Read-only transactions do not exist in this view, because they are not assigned a transaction ID due too much overhead. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See query below 
  
    SELECT tx.trx_id
    FROM information_schema.innodb_trx tx
    WHERE tx.trx_mysql_thread_id = connection_id()
