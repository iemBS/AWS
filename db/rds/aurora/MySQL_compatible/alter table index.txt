Alter Table Index
Note:
  -There is no way to alter an index on a table. You need to drop it and then recreate it
  -The alter statements keeps you from dropping the table during the change though
  -See "Drop Table Index" and "Create Table Index" in other indexes
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Drop Table Index
    "Drop Table Index"
  2. Create Table Index
    "Create Table Index"
