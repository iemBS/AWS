Create Message
Note:

  -A SIGNAL statement always specifies an SQLSTATE value, either directly, or indirectly by referring to a named condition defined with an SQLSTATE value.
  -The first two characters of an SQLSTATE value are its class, and the class determines the default value for the condition information items
  -Class = '00' is illegal because SQLSTATE values that begin with '00' indicate success and are not valid for SIGNAL.
  -The intent of SIGNAL is to raise a user-generated error explicitly, so a signal is never ignored.
  -SQLSTATE values @ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLSTATE
  -ER_SIGNAL_WARN, ER_SIGNAL_NOT_FOUND and ER_SIGNAL_EXCEPTION constants are not accessible from SQL so probably it makes sense to say that they are respectively 1642, 1643 and 1644.
