  -The BEGIN at the start of a stored program (procedure, function, trigger, or event) does not mean the start of a transaction. You need to have "START TRANSACTION" at the start of a stored program to have a transaction in one.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. A session runs "LOCK TABLES", while already holding locks.
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Run "START TRANSACTION"
    1a1. "UNLOCK TABLES" is run implicitly
    1a2. Go to step 2
