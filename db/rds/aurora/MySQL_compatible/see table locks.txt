Main Success Scenario:
  1. See code below

      SELECT 
        r.trx_id waiting_trx_id,
        r.trx_mysql_thread_id waiting_thread,
        r.trx_query waiting_query,
        b.trx_id blocking_trx_id,
        b.trx_mysql_thread_id blocking_thread,
        b.trx_query blocking_query
      FROM 
        information_schema.innodb_lock_waits w
        INNER JOIN information_schema.innodb_trx b ON
          b.trx_id = w.blocking_trx_id
        INNER JOIN information_schema.innodb_trx r ON
          r.trx_id = w.requesting_trx_id;
       
 Alternatives:
   1a. See meta data locks, which are related to DDL
     1a1. show engine innodb status;
     1a2. Look into the TRANSACTION section which will show all waiting thread block by other.
     
In order to allow transaction wait for longer on DML locks you can change variable "innodb_lock_wait_timeout". To change variables in RDS refer to this link http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.html
