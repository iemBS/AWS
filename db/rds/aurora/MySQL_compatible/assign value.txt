Assign Value
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/assignment-operators.html
  -When used in a SET statement, = is treated identically to :=.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Use "=" with the SET keyword
Alternatives:
  1a. Use "=" with SET in an update statement
    1a1. xxx:fill in
  1b. Use ":=" to assign a value
    1b1. xxx:fill in
