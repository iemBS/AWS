Use Log
Pre-Conditions:
  -Logs are found @ AWS > CloudWatch > CloudWatch Logs > Log groups
Note: 
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-logs.html
    -https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/using-log-files.html
    -https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Concepts.MySQL.html
  -RDS also has the Audit log that does not exist in MySQL. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See what OS the MySQL software runs on
    select 
      @@version_compile_machine As 64Bit,
      @@version_compile_os As OsName
  2. "Use Error Log"
  3. "Use General Query Log"
  4. "Use Binary Log"
  5. "Use Relay Log"
  6. "Use Slow query Log"
  7. "Use DDL Log"
  8. "Use Audit Log"

Use Error Log
Pre-Conditions:
  -This log is found in /aws/rds/cluster/[aurora instance]/error
Note:
  -This log covers problems encountered starting, running, or stopping mysqld
    -record of mysqld startup and shutdown times. 
    -diagnostic messages (from server startup, shutdown, and while running)
      -errors
      -warnings
      -notes
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/error-log.html
    -https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Concepts.MySQL.html#USER_LogAccess.MySQLDB.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs
  -If the SQLSTATE is custom and unique it can be found in the Audit log. 
  -Searches with the Log Stream search textbox are case sensitive. Putting double quotes around your values makes it an exact search. 
Question:
  -What are the warnings in the log stream that have "Warning" instead of "[Warning]"?
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Find Errors
    Look for "[Error]" in the Message column of the log entry
  2. Find Warnings
    Look for "[Warning]" in the Message column of the log entry
  3. Find Notes
    Look for "[Note]" in the Message column of the log entry
Alternatives:
  1a. Error log is not published to CloudWatch frequent enough
    1a1. Search Error log using CLI
      xxx:fill in
    
    
Use General Query Log
Note:
  -This log covers established client connections and statements received from clients
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/query-log.html
  -What account writes to this log:
    -MySQLd
  -Statements written to the query log in the order that it is received (might differ from the order in which they are executed). This logging order contrasts with that of the Binary log.
    -Select statement
    -Set statement
    -COMMIT
    -Insert statement
  -The query log may contain statements that only select data while such statements are never written to the binary log.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Confirm General Query Log is enabled
    Select @@GLOBAL.general_log;
  x. 
  x. xxx:fill in
Alternatives:
  1a. Enable General Query log
    1a1. SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';
    1a2. Go to step 2. 
  
Use Binary Log
Note: 
  -This log covers statements that change data (also used for replication)
  -Statements are written after they are executed but before any locks are released
Main Success Scenario:
  1.xxx:fill in

Use Relay Log
Note:
  -This log covers data changes received from a replication source server
Main Success Scenario:
  1.xxx:fill in

Use Slow query log
Note: 
  -Queries that took more than long_query_time seconds to execute
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/slow-query-log.html
Main Success Scenario:
  1.xxx:fill in
  
Use DDL Log
Note: 
  -Also called Metadata log
  -This log covers metadata operations performed by DDL statements
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/ddl-log.html
Main Success Scenario:
  1.xxx:fill in
  
Use Audit Log
Note:
  -This is not a MySQL log, but it is an RDS log
  -Text of a forced error or warning can be found in this log. Handy if trying to understand why an error or warning is not showing in the Error log. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Search for the text of the forced error or warning
