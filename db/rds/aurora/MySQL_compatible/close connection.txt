   -In Aurora the 'cleaned up' state is the final state of a connection whose work is complete but which has not been closed from the client side. In MySQL this field is left blank (no State) in the same circumstance.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See if Command = "SLEEP" and State = "cleaned up" in Information_Schema.ProcessList
  2. If so, run KILL [ID], where ID is a column in that table
