  -The "RESET QUERY CACHE" query needs RELOAD privileges
  -"FLUSH QUERY CACHE" does NOT clear out the query cache, it simply defrags it leaving the cached query results in place
Question
  -Are there instances where "RESET QUERY CACHE" does not work?
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Run the select statement with the "SQL_NO_CACHE" option
    SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE id, name FROM customer;
Alternatives:
  1a. Clear the query cache after you have already run the query
    1a1. Run the query below
      RESET QUERY CACHE 
    1a2. Run query again
