Group and Count on Same Column
Note:
  -You can group and count on the same column, because the count appears to be applied before the group by. 
  -This is beneficial because you can return the values of the same column that you have an aggregation filter on
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See code below
  
    drop temporary table if exists tbl;
    create temporary table tbl
    (
      col int
    );

    Insert Into 
      tbl
    values (1),(1),(2),(3);

    Select
      *
    From
      tbl;

    Select
      col
    From
      tbl
    Group By
      col
    Having
      count(col) = 1
