Group and Count on Same Column
Note:
  -You can group and count on the same column, because the count appears to be applied before the group by. 
  -This is beneficial because you can return the values of the same column that you have an aggregation filter on
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See code below
  
    drop temporary table if exists tbl;
    create temporary table tbl
    (
      col int

    values (1),(1),(2),(3);

    Select
