Drop Table Index
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_create_index.asp
  -DEALLOCATE is not needed with the prepared statement below. A prepared statement is specific to the session in which it was created. If you terminate a session without deallocating a previously prepared statement, the server deallocates it at session termination.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. ALTER TABLE MyTbl DROP INDEX idx_MyTbl_MyCols;
Alternatives:
  1a. Alternative command format that is also a table alter
    1a1. Drop Index idx_MyTbl_MyCols On MyTbl;
  1b. Drop index only if it already exists (by name)
    1b1. See code below
    
    Set @x := (Select Count(*) from Information_Schema.Statistics Where Table_Schema = 'MyDB' And Table_Name = 'MyTbl' and Index_Name = 'MyIndex');
    Set @sql := if(@x = 0, 'select ''Index Does NOT exist.''', 'Drop Index MyIndex On MyTbl;');
    PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    
  1c. Drop index only if it already exists (by index definition)
    1c1. See code below
