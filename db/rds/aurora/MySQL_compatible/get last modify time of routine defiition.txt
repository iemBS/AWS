Main Success Scenario:
  1. The Last_Altered column below cannot be used if running in an AWS Aurora serverless environment  
  
    SELECT
      Routine_Schema As DbNm,
        Routine_Name As RtnNm,
        Routine_Type As RtnTyp,
      created As CreateTm,
        Last_Altered As LstModTm
    FROM 
      Information_Schema.Routines
    Where
      Routine_Schema = 'MyDbNm'
    Order By
      Routine_Schema
Alternatives:
  1a. Use SHOW Procedure for procedures 
    SHOW Procedure STATUS WHERE Db = 'MyTableName' And Name = 'MyProcedureName'
  1b. Use SHOW Function for functions
    SHOW Function STATUS WHERE Db = 'MyTableName' And Name = 'MyProcedureName' And Modified > @dt;
  1c. Get updated functions from the Information_Schema.Routines table 
    1c1. Use the below query to get updated functions
      select 
      Routine_Schema As DbNm,
        Routine_Type AS ObjType,
        Routine_Name AS ObjNm,
        Created As CreatedDt,
        Last_Altered As LastModDt
    From
      Information_Schema.Routines
    Where
      Routine_Type = 'FUNCTION'
        And
        Routine_Schema = 'MyDbNm'
        And 
        Last_Altered > @dt
