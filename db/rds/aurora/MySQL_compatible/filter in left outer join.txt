Filter in Left Outer Join
Note:
  -Filtering on the left table will not throw an error and will not filter data. It will be ignored. 
  -Filtering of the right table will turn the left outer join into an inner join. https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/outer-join-simplification.html
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Place filter in the WHERE clause
