    1a1. xxx:fill in
    1a2. Go to Step 2
  1b. Thread's connection to the server is closed
    1b1. Do any automatic UNLOCK TABLES;
    1b2. Go to Step 2
  1c. Release a lock with a specific name
    1c1. RELEASE_LOCK("MyLock");
    1c2. That table lock is released
    1c3. Go to step 3. 
  1d. Release all currently named locks
    1d1. RELEASE_ALL_LOCKS();
    1d2. Go to Step 3
