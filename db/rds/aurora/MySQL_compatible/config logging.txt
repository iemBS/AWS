Config Logging
Note: 
  -Log events from Aurora are published in the form of log streams (sequences of log events) to log groups in Amazon CloudWatch. Each DB instance and log type creates a separate group in the same AWS Region as the DB instance, with the following naming pattern:
    -/aws/rds/[instance]/[db-instance-id]/[log-type]
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Config Logging for Error Log"
  2. xxx:fill in

Config Logging for Error Log
Pre-Conditions:
  -The log_error_verbosity system variable can be configuraable from MySQL, because the parameter of the same name in the RDS Parameter Group will indicate "engine-default" in the "Source" column. 
Note:
  -Values allowed for log_error_verbosity system variable:
    -1 (errors only)
    -2 (errors and warnings)
    -3 (errors, warnings, and notes), default
  -If the value of log_error_verbosity is greater than 2, the server logs aborted connections and access-denied errors for new connection attempts.

  -The MySQL error log is written to the mysql-error.log file. 
  -You can view mysql-error.log by using ...
    -Amazon RDS console
    -retrieving the log using ...
      -Amazon RDS API
      -Amazon RDS CLI
      -AWS SDKs
  -mysql-error.log is flushed every 5 minutes, and its contents are appended to mysql-error-running.log. 
  -The mysql-error-running.log file is then rotated every hour and the hourly files generated during the last 24 hours are retained. 
    -Note that the retention period is different between Amazon RDS and Aurora.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Set log_error_verbosity system variable to control server verbosity for writing error, warning, and note messages to the error log.
  2. xxx:fill in
