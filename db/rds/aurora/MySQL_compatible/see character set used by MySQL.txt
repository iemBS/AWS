Main Success Scenario:
  1. USE MyDB; 
     SELECT @@character_set_database; # gives abbreviated name
  2. SHOW CHARACTER SET; # Shows map of abbreviated character set name to full name. Important for "latin1", which is used to refer to CP1252 and ISO 8859-1 character sets depending on who you talk to. 
  3. See character sets used in other areas of MySQL for a session
      SELECT 
        * 
      FROM 
        INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSION_VARIABLES
      WHERE 
        VARIABLE_NAME IN 
          (
          'character_set_client', 
          'character_set_connection',
              'character_set_database',
              'character_set_filesystem',
          'character_set_results',
