Break Data with Bad Query Format
Pre-Conditions:
  -All these bad query formats will not throw a default mysql error when implementing or running
  -All these bad query formats will make the data incorrect
Main Success Format
  1. Missing comma in IN statement causes that filter value and others after it to be ignored. 
  
    select
      *
    from
      information_schema.tables
    where
      table_schema = 'information_schema'
        and
        table_name in 
        (
        'columns',
            'tables'
            'files'
        );
        
   2. End
 Alternatives:
   1a. Missing comma in select statement causes all columns after the columns with the missing comma to be ignored (so each new column associates to the comma that precedes it)
     1a1. see below 
     
       select
        table_name
          table_type
      from
        information_schema.tables
      where
        table_schema = 'information_schema'
          and
          table_name in 
          (
          'columns',
              'tables',
              'files'
          )
   
   1b. xxx:fill in 
 
 
     1a2. Go to step 2
