Get Table Row Count
Note: 
  -Guidance @ https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-row-count/
  -If using the InndoDB storage engine, the Table_Rows value in Information_Schema.tables is an approximation and can be off by as much as 50%.
    -See @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-schema-tables-table.html
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See query below
  
      SELECT 
          table_name, 
          table_rows
      FROM
          information_schema.tables
      WHERE
          table_schema = 'classicmodels'
      ORDER BY table_name;
      
Alternatives:
  1a. If using InnoDB storage engine do not rely on table_rows column in Information_Schema.tables
    1a1. Generate a query for each table that calls count(*)
          
    1a2. xxx
  1b. Get row count of all tables in database
