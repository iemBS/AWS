Choose Definer for SQL objects
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/create-procedure.html
    -"DEFINER" defines the security context of a procedure 
    -The "DEFINER" clause specifies the MySQL account to be used when checking access privileges at procedure execution time for procedures that have the "SQL SECURITY DEFINER" characteristic.
    -Within the body of a procedure that is defined with the "SQL SECURITY DEFINER" characteristic, the CURRENT_USER function returns the procedures's DEFINER value.

  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/stored-objects-security.html#stored-objects-security-sql-security
    -For stored procedures and views, the object definition can include a SQL SECURITY characteristic with a value of DEFINER or INVOKER to specify whether the object executes in definer or invoker context. If the definition omits the SQL SECURITY characteristic, the default is definer context.
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/stored-objects-security.html#stored-objects-security-orphan-objects
    -An object can be orphaned if the account that creates it no longer exists or is an account that never existed
