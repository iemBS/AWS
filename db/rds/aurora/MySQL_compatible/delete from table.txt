  -If you are deleting many rows from a large table, you may exceed the lock table size for an InnoDB table.
    -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size
    -innodb_buffer_pool_size is the size in bytes of the buffer pool, the memory area where InnoDB caches table and index data.
    -Divide innodb_buffer_pool_size by xxx to get megabytes and by xxx to get gigabytes
    -Guidance @ https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/57497/the-total-number-of-locks-exceeds-the-lock-table-size-even-after-increasing-buf
  -The innodb_buffer_pool_instances system variable creates more than one instance of a buffer pool. 1 means one buffer pool instance. 2 means two buffer pool instances. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. DELETE FROM somelog WHERE user = 'jcole'
Alternatives:
  1a. Delete from a table while joined to another table
    1a1. xxx:fill in
  1b. Delete from two tables that are joined 
    1b1. xxx:fill in
  1c. Delete from right table while using the left table to filter the right table
    1c1. See query below
    
          Delete 
            b
          From
            tblA a
            Inner Join tblB b On 
              a.ID = b.ID
  1d. Delete rows in a certain order and up to a specific row count
    1d1. "Delete rows in a certain order and up to a specific row count"
  1e. Lock table size exceeded error occurs
    1e1. Update the innodb_buffer_pool_size system variable (in bytes) to have more space 

Delete rows in a certain order and up to a specific row count
Note:
  -If the DELETE statement includes an ORDER BY clause, rows are deleted in the order specified by the clause. This is useful primarily in conjunction with LIMIT. For example, the following statement finds rows matching the WHERE clause, sorts them by timestamp_column, and deletes the first (oldest) one
  -ORDER BY also helps to delete rows in an order required to avoid referential integrity violations.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See code below
        DELETE FROM somelog WHERE user = 'jcole'
        ORDER BY timestamp_column LIMIT 1;
