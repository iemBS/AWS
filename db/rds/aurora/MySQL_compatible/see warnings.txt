See Warnings
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/show-warnings.html
  -SHOW WARNINGS is a diagnostic statement that displays information about the conditions (errors, warnings, and notes) resulting from executing a statement in the current session.
  -Enable seeing warnings when running SQL Queries
    -"Show warnings enabled" command does not work in Aurora serverless environment 
  -Disable seeing warnings when running SQL Queries
    -"Show nowarning enabled" command does not work in Aurora serverless environment 
  -SELECT @@warning_count will clear the message list in "SHOW WARNINGS" if run. 
  -Warnings cannot be returned from stored functions because the RETURN statement that causes the function to return clears the diagnostic area. The statement thus clears any warnings that may have been present there (and resets warning_count to 0).
  -"warning_count" is only a session variable. 
  -SHOW WARNINGS only shows warnings for the latest statement. 
  -SHOW WARNINGS gets its messages from the Diagnostic Area
Main Success Scenario:
  1. SHOW WARNINGS; 
  2. END
Alternatives:
  1a. Get count of warnings 
    1a1. SHOW COUNT(*) WARNINGS;
    1a2. END
  1b. Get count of warnings via the system variable
    1b1. Select @@Session.warning_count;
    1b2. END
  1c. Warnings gone since max_error_count was exceeded
    1c1. The oldest warning, error, and note messages in SHOW WARNINGS have been pushed out to limit to the number of messages in max_error_count
    1c2. END
