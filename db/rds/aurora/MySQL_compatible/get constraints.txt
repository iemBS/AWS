Get Constraints
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See queries below

    # Get names of constraints
    Drop Temporary Table if Exists Tmp_Constraint;
    Create Temporary Table Tmp_Constraint
    Select
      Constraint_Schema As DbConstraintIsIn,
        Constraint_Name As ConstraintNm,
        Table_Schema As DbTblIsInThatConstraintIsOn,
        Table_Name As TblNm,
        Constraint_Type As ConstraintTyp
    From
      information_schema.table_constraints 
    Where
      Constraint_Schema = 'MyDb'
    Order By
      Constraint_Schema,
        Constraint_Name;

    # Get names of columns involved
    Drop Temporary Table If Exists Tmp_Constraint_Col;
    Create Temporary Table Tmp_Constraint_Col
    Select
      t.DbConstraintIsIn,
        t.ConstraintNm,
        t.DbTblIsInThatConstraintIsOn,
        t.TblNm,
        t.ConstraintTyp,
        cu.Column_Name As ColNm,
        cu.Ordinal_Position As ColPosInTbl,
        cu.Position_In_Unique_Constraint As ColPosInUniqueConstraint,
        cu.Referenced_Table_Schema As RefDbNm,
        cu.Referenced_Table_Name As RefTblNm,
        cu.Referenced_Column_Name As RefColNm
    From
      Tmp_Constraint t
      Inner Join information_schema.key_column_usage cu On 
        t.DbConstraintIsIn = cu.Constraint_Schema
            And
            t.ConstraintNm = cu.Constraint_Name

    # Foreign key constraints
    Select
      *
    From
      information_schema.referential_constraints
