Main Successs Scenario:
  1. Use NOT IN filter
    xxx:fill in 
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Use Left Outer Join
    1a1. xxx:fill in 
    1a2. Go to step 2
  1b. Use NOT EXISTS with correlated sub-query
    1b1. xxx:fill in 
    1b2. Go to step 2
  1c. Flag a column
    1c1. Join tableA to tableB and update tableB column to have a value of X
    1c2. select all records from tableB where column is not X
  1d. Use work table
    1d1. Insert all IDs from tableB into id table
    1d2. Join tableA to id table and delete rows in id table where the ids match
    1d3. Join id table to tableB to get only the tableB rows you want
  1e. Use correlated sub-query as updated value (only do if updating one column and tableA has few rows)
    1e1. xxx:fill in
