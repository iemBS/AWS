Start Event Scheduler
Pre-Conditions:
  -For Serverless Aurora that uses the MySQL engine, the "event_scheduler" system variable cannot be set to "ON". 
    -Running "SET @@Global.event_scheduler = 'ON';" will result in this error:
      Error Code: 1227. Access denied; you need (at least one of) the SUPER privilege(s) for this operation
  -Only certain parameters in RDS (known as system variables in MySQL) can be changed (& used) for a Serverless Aurora instance. "event_scheduler" is not one of those that can be changed (& used). For the parameters that cannot be changed, the default MySQL value is used. The default for "event_handler" is "OFF". 
    -You can change the value for the "event_handler" paraemter in the RDS parameter group and save it, but it does not push the value to MySQL
    -This "event_handler" is not in the list of changable RDS parameters on the list @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.how-it-works.html
Note:
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/events-configuration.html
    -https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_event_scheduler
    -https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/rds-modify-parameter-group-values/
  -Event Scheduler must be on to run any events
  -value changes to the event_scheduler variable in RDS are allowed while MySQL is running
  -MySQL system variables are called parameters in RDS
  -When you change a dynamic parameter in RDS and save the DB parameter group, the change is applied immediately regardless of the Apply Immediately setting.
  -If a DB instance isn't using the latest changes to its associated DB parameter group, the AWS Management Console shows the DB parameter group with a status of pending-reboot. The pending-reboot parameter groups status doesn't result in an automatic reboot during the next maintenance window. To apply the latest parameter changes to that DB instance, manually reboot the DB instance.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Amazon RDS web UI
  2. On the left side bar, click on "Parameter groups"
  3. Find parameter group 
  4. search for "event_scheduler" using search textbox
  5. click "Edit parameters" button
  6. choose "ON" from drop down menu
  7. click "Save changes" button
  8. The "event_scheduler" value in MySQL will update immediately
    select @@Global.event_scheduler;
