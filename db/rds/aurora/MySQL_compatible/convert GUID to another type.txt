Convert GUID to another type
Note:
  -"Select CAST(UUID() As varchar(36))" throws an error
  -The value from UUID() is 36 characters long (that includes the dashes too)
  -With "Set @uuid = UUID()", the value gets stored as a binary data type and the value will not show in the client window.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Cast GUID as a char(36)
  
  Select
    UUID() As guid,
    CAST(UUID() As char(36)) As char36
    
Alternatives:
  1a. Put GUID into a Varchar(36) column
    1a1. See code below
    
      Drop Temporary Table If Exists tmp;
      Create Temporary Table tmp(
      varchar36 varchar(36),
      char36 char(36)
      );

      Insert Into
      tmp
      (
        char36
      )
      Values (UUID());

      Update
      tmp
      Set 
      varchar36 = char36;

      # returns values
      Select 
      *
      From
      tmp
      Where
      char36 = varchar36
