Main Success Scenario:
  1. Error occurs when your SQL code is running
  2. Stop Executing SQL code
  3. SQL code is quit in a middle of a transaction
  4. End
Alternatives:
  1a. Disconnecting query from the database
    1a1. xxx:fill in
    1a2. go to Step 4
  1b. A deadlock or lock-wait timeout occurs
    1b1. xxx:fill in
    1b2. go to Step 4
  1c. "autocommit" is disabled and session ends without ending final transaction
    1c1. MySQL rolls back that transaction.
    1c2. go to Step 4
