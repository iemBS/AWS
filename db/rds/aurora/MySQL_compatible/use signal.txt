Use Signal
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/signal.html
  -SQLSTATE values that begin with '01' are signals in the warning class. The warning does not terminate the procedure, and can be seen with SHOW WARNINGS after the procedure returns.
  -All SQLSTATE classes and possible values @ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLSTATE
  -https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-signal-resignal/
  -The RESIGNAL  statement is similar to SIGNAL  statement in term of functionality and syntax, except that:
    -You must use the RESIGNAL  statement within an error or warning handler, otherwise, you will get an error message saying that “RESIGNAL when the handler is not active”. Notice that you can use SIGNAL  statement anywhere inside a stored procedure.
    -You can omit all attributes of the RESIGNAL statement, even the SQLSTATE value.
    -If you use the RESIGNAL statement alone, all attributes are the same as the ones passed to the condition handler.
    -MYSQL_ERRNO is a MySQL extension
    -Value for MYSQL_ERRNO does not need to align with the SQLSTATE. It will cause confusion for anyone looking at it.
    -Use "SHOW WARNINGS" to see warnings generated with a SIGNAL statement
      -MESSAGE_TEXT value will show in "Message" column of results
      -MYSQL_ERRNO value will show in "Code" column of results
    -Use "SHOW ERRORS" to see errors generated with a SIGNAL statement
      -MESSAGE_TEXT value will show in "Message" column of results
      -MYSQL_ERRNO value will show in "Code" column of results
Main Success Scenario:
  1. SIGNAL SQLSTATE '01000';
  2. End
Alternatives:
  1a. Signal an unhandled user-defined exception
    1a1. SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000';
    1a2. End
  1b. Signal successful completion
    1b1. The SQLSTATE is "00000", but you cannot make a SIGNAL call with that 
    1b2. End
  1c. Signal custom error with spaces that is derived from "45000" SQLSTATE
    1c1. 
      DECLARE My_Custom_Error CONDITION FOR SQLSTATE '45000';
      SIGNAL My_Custom_Error
     1c2. End
  1d. Signal custom error with spaces that is derived from "45000" SQLSTATE
    1d1. See code below 
      DECLARE `My Custom Error` CONDITION FOR SQLSTATE '45000';
      SIGNAL `My Custom Error`
    1d2. End
  1e. Set MESSAGE_TEXT in SIGNAL statement
    1e1. See code below 
      SIGNAL SQLSTATE '01000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'A warning occurred'
  1f. Set MYSQL_ERRNO in SIGNAL statement
    1f1. See code below
      SIGNAL SQLSTATE '01000'
        SET MYSQL_ERRNO = 1000;
  1z. Use Resignal instead of Signal
