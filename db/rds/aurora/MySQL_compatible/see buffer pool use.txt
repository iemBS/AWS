See Buffer Pool Use
Note: 
  -The records where Data_Size is 0 just has the index or table definition. 
  -innodb_buffer_pool_size system variable @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size
    -The size in bytes of the buffer pool, the memory area where InnoDB caches table and index data. 
    -A larger buffer pool requires less disk I/O to access the same table data more than once. 
    -Buffer pool size must always be equal to or a multiple of innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size * innodb_buffer_pool_instances.
    -If you alter the buffer pool size to a value that is not equal to or a multiple of innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size * innodb_buffer_pool_instances, buffer pool size is automatically adjusted to a value that is equal to or a multiple of innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size * innodb_buffer_pool_instances.
    -Can be set dynamically, which allows you to resize the buffer pool without restarting the server.
  -innodb_buffer_pool_instances system variable @ https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_instances
    -The number of regions that the InnoDB buffer pool is divided into.
    -For systems with buffer pools in the multi-gigabyte range, dividing the buffer pool into separate instances can improve concurrency, by reducing contention as different threads read and write to cached pages.
    -Each page that is stored in or read from the buffer pool is assigned to one of the buffer pool instances randomly, using a hashing function.
    -This option only takes effect when setting innodb_buffer_pool_size to 1GB or more. 
    -The total buffer pool size is divided among all the buffer pools.

  -Avoiding running queries against the Information_Schema.INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE table in a production environment. There will be a performance impact on queries running.

Main Success Scenario:
  1. See total Buffer Pool use

    select
      ((Sum(Data_Size)/1024)/1024) As Data_SizeInMB,
        (((Sum(Data_Size)/1024)/1024)/1024) As Data_SizeInGB
    From
      Information_Schema.INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE  
    Where
      Data_Size <> 0
