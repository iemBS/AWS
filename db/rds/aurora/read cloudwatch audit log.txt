    Each part defined
    ---------------------
    TimeStamp: The Unix time stamp for the logged event with microsecond precision.
    UserName: Security context the object is running under
    UserHost: IP Address or server name that the object run request came from. If requests are coming from more than one IP address at a time, filtering on IP address can help you discern between the requests in the log. 
    ConnectionId: The connection ID number for the logged operation.
    QueryId: The query ID number, which can be used for finding the relational table events and related queries. For TABLE events, multiple lines are added.
    Operation: The recorded action type. Possible values are: CONNECT, QUERY, READ, WRITE, CREATE, ALTER, RENAME, and DROP. QUERY will be used for Non-DDL SQL queries and procedure calls. 
    Database: The active database, as set by the USE command.
    Object: For QUERY events, this value indicates the query that the database performed. For TABLE events, it indicates the table name. This is empty if Operation is DISCONNECT.
    ReturnCode: The return code of the logged operation. If the operation has an error, then it is a MySQL error code.
