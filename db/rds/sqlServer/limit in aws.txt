Limit in AWS
Notes:
  -Guidance @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.Limits
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Max # of DBs on a DB instance depends on the instance class type and the availability mode
  2. Some ports are reserved for Amazon RDS, and you can't use them when you create a DB instance. 
  3. Client connections from IP addresses within the range 169.254.0.0/16 are not permitted. This is the Automatic Private IP Addressing Range (APIPA), which is used for local-link addressing.
  4. SQL Server Standard Edition will use only a subset of the available processors if the DB instance has more processors than the software limits (24 cores, 4 sockets, and 128GB RAM).
  5. Amazon RDS for SQL Server doesn't support importing data into the msdb database. 
  6. You can't rename databases on a DB instance in a SQL Server Multi-AZ deployment. 
  7. The min storage size for SQL Server DB instances is the following:
      General Purpose (SSD) storage – 20 GiB for Enterprise, Standard, Web, and Express editions
      Provisioned IOPS storage – 20 GiB for Enterprise and Standard editions, 100 GiB for Web and Express editions
      Magnetic storage – 200 GiB for Enterprise and Standard editions, 20 GiB for Web and Express editions
  8.Amazon RDS doesn't support running these services on the same server as your Amazon RDS DB instance: SQL Server Analysis Services, SQL Server Integration Services, SQL Server Reporting Services, Data Quality Services, Master Data Services
  9.The following server-level roles are not currently available in Amazon RDS:
      bulkadmin
      dbcreator
      diskadmin
      securityadmin
      serveradmin
      sysadmin
  10.Some server-level permissions are not available on SQL Server DB instances
  11. Limited to specific versions as noted @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport
  12. Features Not Supported or with limited support @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.FeatureNonSupport
