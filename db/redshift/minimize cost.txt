  -Guidance @ https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/
  -Guidance @ https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/#Reserved_Instance_Pricing
  -Redshift Spectrum only scans columns needed by the query
  -Guidance @ https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/
Main Success Scenario:
  1.Use instances that are reserved rather than on-demand
  2.The longer time you reserve, the better deal you get
  3.Use Redshift Spectrum to compress data
  4.Store data in columnar format (Parquet, ORC)
  5.Minimize use of AWS Glue Data Catalog
  6.Minimize use of AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
  7.Use Pricing Calculator @ https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/#Pricing_calculator
  8.Minimize time held & # of backups
  9.Minimize time held and # of snapshots
  10.Minimize amount of data movement to other AWS services
