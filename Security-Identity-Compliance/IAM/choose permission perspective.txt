  1a. Permissions will be fewer if we set on the Actee
    1a1. "Set Permissions on the Actee"
    1a2. Go to step 2
  1b. Permissions will be easier to manage if we set on the Actee
    1b1. "Set Permissions on the Actee"
    1b2. Go to step 2
  1c. All Actors will be accessing the Actee with the same permissions 
    1c1. "Set Permissions on the Actee"
    1c2. Go to step 2
