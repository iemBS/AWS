note
-A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions
-Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied
-Use groups for easier permissions management
-Users or groups can have multiple policies attached to them that grant different permissions. In that case, the permissions for the users are calculated based on the combination of policies. 
-With all those attached policies, if the user has not been granted an explicit permission for an action and a resource, the user does not have those permissions.
