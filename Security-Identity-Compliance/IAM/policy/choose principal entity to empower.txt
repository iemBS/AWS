Choose Principal Entity to Empower
Note:
  -Examples of a service are glue or lambda
  -An entity that can perform an activity is a person or a service
  -A principal entity can be granted the access to perform an activity
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Grant a service access to perform an activity (no matter what person, role, or other service runs this service it is allowed to do the activity)
  2. end
Alternatives:
  1a. Grant a role that uses the service to perform an activity (only a specific role that uses the service can perform the activity)
    1a1. go to step 2
  1b. Grant a user that uses the service to perform an activity (only a specific user that uses the service can perform the activity)
    1b2. go to step 2
