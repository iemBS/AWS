  -The trust policy defines which principals can assume the role, and under which conditions
  -A trust policy is a specific type of resource-based policy for IAM roles
  -A trust policy needs to be associated with a role during role creation, becasue it defines the most basic usage of the role
  -actions used in a trust policy
    -sts:AssumeRole
    -sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
    -sts:AssumeRoleWithSAML
    -sts:SetSourceIdentity
    -sts:TagSession
  -Condition elements of role trust policies behave identically to condition elements in identity-based policies and other resource policies on AWS.
  -Services like AWS Lambda and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) assume roles to deliver temporary credentials to your code thatâ€™s running in them.
