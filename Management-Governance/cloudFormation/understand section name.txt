note
-section name is the Logical ID in the CloudFormation console
-the "Mappings" section name does not show in the Logical ID column of the Events tab in the CloudFormation console
-the "Output" section name does not show in the Logical ID column of the Events tab in the CloudFormation console

what about conditions, transforms, resources pre-defined sections ?
