Monitor CloudWatch Action Cost
-----------------------------------------
-Read from Log
  -Watch # of 3rd Party tool reads
  -stay aware of log quotas, ref @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/cloudwatch_limits_cwl.html
  -Use default CloudWatch Logs metrics (see "AWS/Logs" namespace) 
    -Look for too many reads, few reads, and none. 
      -Too many reads could indicate a process that needs to be change to less frequent or on-demand
      -Too few reads could mean a log group that could be dropped or the need of a retention policy to remove older log streams within a log group
-Write to Log
  -default IncomingBytes metric
  -stay aware of log quotas, ref @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/cloudwatch_limits_cwl.html
  -Use default CloudWatch Logs metrics (see "AWS/Logs" namespace) 
    -Look for too many writes, few writes, and none. 
      -Too many could mean a service needs to remove types of logging or reduce logging resolution 
      -Too few could mean valuable performance info is not being used or a log group is not needed 


Reduce CloudWatch Action Cost
-----------------------------------------
-Access Log
  -Do not access the log from the AWS CloudWatch GUI if you do not need to look at it, because a read will occur
-Read from Log
  -Using shorter time windows, reduces the amount of data scanned
  -Reduce number of Log Insights query runs
  -Remove uneeded alarms
  -read from specific log streams instead of all log streams in a log group
-Write to Log
  -Reduce number of writes to log
  -Batch multiple PutMetricData requests into one API call
  -Pre-aggregate metric data into a StatisticSet
  -Reduce log resolution (time between writes)
  -Write specific start and end entries rather than regular writes for a specific resolution


Monitor CloudWatch Storage Cost
-----------------------
-Store Log
  -Watch log group size with 
    -the describe-log-group CLI command, ref @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/logs/describe-log-groups.html
    -"Stored bytes" values on the CloudWatch > Log groups > [log group name] page in AWS CloudWatch GUI
  -Watch age of entries 
  -stay aware of log quotas, ref @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/cloudwatch_limits_cwl.html
    -creatng dashboards comparing log usage numbers to quotes is monitoring on your monitoring and ideally avoided 


Reduce CloudWatch Storage Cost
-----------------------
-Store Log
  -implement a retention policy
  -aggregate entries to large time intervals and doing so after specified # of iterations of the time window occur (combine with retention policy)
    -all entries to hour entries @ end of week
    -all hour entries to day entries @ end of week
    -all day entries to week entries @ end of week
    -all week entries to month entries @ end of month
