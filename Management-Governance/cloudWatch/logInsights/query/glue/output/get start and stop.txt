Get Start and Stop
Pre-Conditions:
  -Need to write custom messages to the log to the glue log to indicate start and stop positions within the glue job code
  -Start and Stop positions need to have common code between them and the same text needs to be unique among all messages written to the log
  -Replace "CommonStartStopText" with common text
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Get detail of stop and start
  
    fields @message,@timestamp,@log
    | filter @message like /(?i)(CommonStartStopText)/ # case in-sensitive; common text in start and end text
    | parse @message /(?<@tbl1>(xxx))/
    | parse @message /(?<@tbl2>(yyy))/
    | parse @message /(?<@tbl3>(zzz))/
    | field Concat(@tbl1,@tbl2,@tbl3) As tbl
    | filter tbl like /(?i)(xxx|yyy|zzz)/ # case in-sensitive
    | parse @log "*:*" As logNm,logPth
    | display logPth,@timestamp,@message,tbl
    | sort @timestamp
    
  2. Get duration between the start and stop for a single day (must have max of one run per start and stop)

    fields @message,@timestamp,@log
    | filter @message like /(?i)(CommonStartStopText)/ # case in-sensitive; common text in start and end text
    | parse @message /(?<@tbl1>(xxx))/
    | parse @message /(?<@tbl2>(yyy))/
    | parse @message /(?<@tbl3>(zzz))/
    | field Concat(@tbl1,@tbl2,@tbl3) As tbl
    | filter tbl like /(?i)(xxx|yyy|zzz)/ # case in-sensitive
    | parse @log "*:*" As logNm,logPth
    | stats earliest(@timestamp) As periodStartMs,latest(@timestamp) As periodEndMs by logPth,tbl
    | field ((periodEndMs-periodStartMs)/1000) As periodInSec
    | field periodInSec/60 As periodInMin
    | fields fromMillis(periodStartMs) As periodStartTs,fromMillis(periodEndMs) As periodEndTs
    | display logPth,periodStartTs,periodEndTs,periodInSec,periodInMin,tbl
    | sort periodStartTs
    
Alternatives:
  2a. Get average duration between start and stop (must have max of one run per start and stop per day)
    2a1. see code below
      xxx:fill in
  2b. Get duration between start and stop for several days (must have max of one run per start and stop per day)
    2b1. xxx:fill in
