Get Avg Daily Ingest Duration
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See code below 
  
      fields @timestamp, @message, @ingestionTime
      | field ((toMillis(@ingestionTime)-toMillis(@timestamp))/1000) as ingestDuration # in seconds
      | field datefloor(@timestamp, 1d) as date
      | stats avg(ingestDuration) as avgIngestDuration group by date
      | display date,avgIngestDuration
      | sort date
  2. End
Alternatives:
  1a. Limit to specific glue job
    1a1. See code below
      fields @timestamp, @message, @ingestionTime
      | filter @message like /(?i)(MyGlueJob)/ # case in-sensitive
      | field ((toMillis(@ingestionTime)-toMillis(@timestamp))/1000) as ingestDuration # in seconds
      | field datefloor(@timestamp, 1d) as date
      | stats avg(ingestDuration) as avgIngestDuration group by date
      | display date,avgIngestDuration
      | sort date
    1a2. Go to step 2
