  -Status_Code of 0 is success and a non-zero value is an error
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See summary level query
    xxx:fill in
  2. See associated detail level query, swap out "ProcName" and "SHIFT" with good values. SHIFT is the ofset from UTC (if preceding UTC leave positive, if after UTC make negative).
