  -Status_Code of 0 is success and a non-zero value is an error
  -This is returning an end, even if the procedure did not end successfully. So, this gives the actual run end time for all procedures.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See summary level query, swap out "myProcA", "myProcB", and "SHIFT" with good values. SHIFT is the ofset from UTC (if preceding UTC leave positive, if after UTC make negative). 
    fields @message,@timestamp
    # base filter
    | filter @message like /(?i),QUERY,/ 
    | filter @message like /(?i),'SET @/ or @message like /(?i),'CALL / # Get start and end of a procedure call 
    | parse @message /(?<@proc1>(\.myProcA))/ # INPUT: procedure name to search for
    | parse @message /(?<@proc2>(\.myProcB))/ # INPUT: procedure name to search for
    | fields concat(@proc1,@proc2) as proc
    | filter (strlen(trim(proc)) > 0)
    # remove records that will return proc references that we do not want
    | filter @message not like /(?i)'CREATE DEFINER=`/ # non-case sensitive filter
    | filter @message not like /(?i)'Drop Procedure / # non-case sensitive filter
    | filter @message not like /(?i)'SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE `/ # non-case sensitive filter

    | field SHIFT * 60 * 60 * 1000 As ShiftHrsInMs
    | field toMillis(@timestamp) As utcTimestampInMs
    | field fromMillis(utcTimestampInMs - ShiftHrsInMs) As localTimestamp # create local time value
    | field datefloor(localTimestamp,1day) as localDay # applied on local time value
    | field fromMillis(toMillis(localDay) + ShiftHrsInMs) As dy # convert to utc because display value will be auto converted to local time
    # parse record 
    | parse @message "*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*" as ts0,svrNm,usr,ip,processId,logId,eventType,db,qry,other
    | parse other /(?<@qryStatus>([^,]*$))/
    # aggregate
    | field ltrim(proc,".") as prc
    | stats count(logId) as sourceRowCount,min(@timestamp) as runStart,max(@timestamp) as runEnd,(max(runEnd)-min(runStart))/1000 as runDuration,max(@qryStatus) as qryStatus by usr,ip,processId,db,prc,dy 
    # display
    | display dy,runStart,runEnd,runDuration,usr,ip,processId,db,prc,sourceRowCount,qryStatus
    | sort dy,runStart 

  2. See associated detail level query, swap out "myProcA", "myProcB", and "SHIFT" with good values. SHIFT is the ofset from UTC (if preceding UTC leave positive, if after UTC make negative).
