Get Procedure Execution Per Day
Pre-Conditions:
  -Replace "ProcName" with the procedure name
  -Replace "SHIFT" with the time zone offset
  -datetime value used in datefloor is a utc value. So, if we are displaying in local time, the timestamp must have the offset applied before the datefloor function and before displaying. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See code below
  
    fields @message,@timestamp
    | filter @message like /(?i),QUERY,/ # non-case sensitive filter
    | filter @message like /(?i)ProcName\(/ # non-case sensitive filter
    # remove records that will return proc references that we do not want
    | filter @message not like /(?i)'CREATE DEFINER=`/ # non-case sensitive filter
    | filter @message not like /(?i)'Drop Procedure / # non-case sensitive filter
    | filter @message not like /(?i)'SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE `/ # non-case sensitive filter
    # get day of run
    | field SHIFT * 60 * 60 * 1000 As ShiftHrsInMs
    | field toMillis(@timestamp) As utcTimestampInMs
    | field fromMillis(utcTimestampInMs - ShiftHrsInMs) As localTimestamp # create local time value
    | field datefloor(localTimestamp,1day) as localDay # applied on local time value
    | field fromMillis(toMillis(localDay) + ShiftHrsInMs) As dy # convert to utc because display value will be auto converted to local time
    # parse record 
    | parse @message "*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*" as ts0,svrNm,usr,ip,processId,logId,eventType,db,qry
    # get runs per day
    | stats count(*) as runCnt by dy,usr
    # display 
    | display dy,runCnt,usr
    | sort dy desc
    
 2. See detail for the above query
 
    fields @message,@timestamp
    | filter @message like /(?i),QUERY,/ # non-case sensitive filter
    | filter @message like /(?i)ProcName\(/ # non-case sensitive filter
    # remove records that will return proc references that we do not want
    | filter @message not like /(?i)'CREATE DEFINER=`/ # non-case sensitive filter
    | filter @message not like /(?i)'Drop Procedure / # non-case sensitive filter
    | filter @message not like /(?i)'SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE `/ # non-case sensitive filter
    # get day of run
    | field SHIFT * 60 * 60 * 1000 As ShiftHrsInMs
    | field toMillis(@timestamp) As utcTimestampInMs
    | field fromMillis(utcTimestampInMs - ShiftHrsInMs) As localTimestamp # create local time value
    | field datefloor(localTimestamp,1day) as localDay # applied on local time value
    | field fromMillis(toMillis(localDay) + ShiftHrsInMs) As dy # convert to utc because display value will be auto converted to local time
    # parse record 
    | parse @message "*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*" as ts0,svrNm,usr,ip,processId,logId,eventType,db,qry
    | display @timestamp,dy,usr,db,qry
    | sort @timestamp desc
