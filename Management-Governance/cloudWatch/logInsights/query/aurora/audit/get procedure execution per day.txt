    | filter @message not like "'CREATE DEFINER=`"
    | filter @message not like "'Drop Procedure "
    | filter @message not like "'SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE `"
    # get day of run
    | field datefloor(@timestamp, 1day) As dy
    # parse record 
    | parse @message "*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*" as ts0,svrNm,usr,ip,processId,logId,eventType,db,qry
    # get runs per day
    | stats count(*) as runCnt by dy
    # display 
    | display dy,runCnt,usr
    | sort dy desc
    
 2. See detail for the above query
 
    fields @message,@timestamp
    | filter @message like ",QUERY," 
    | filter @message like "ProcName("
    # remove records that will return proc references that we do not want
    | filter @message not like "'CREATE DEFINER=`"
    | filter @message not like "'Drop Procedure "
    | filter @message not like "'SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE `"
    # get day of run
    | field datefloor(@timestamp, 1day) As dy
    # parse record 
    | parse @message "*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*" as ts0,svrNm,usr,ip,processId,logId,eventType,db,qry
    # get runs per day
    | stats count(*) as runCnt by dy,qry
    # display 
    | display dy,runCnt,usr,qry
    | sort dy desc,qry asc
