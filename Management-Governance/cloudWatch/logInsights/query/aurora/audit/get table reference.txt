Get Table Reference
Pre-Conditions:
  -Replace "MyTable" in the code below with the name of your table. Use the same case as has in Aurora
Note:
  -When looking for more than one table, if any table name is a substring of another, look for the longer named table first. This will prevent mis-identifying the table.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Get count of table references
    fields @message,@timestamp
    | filter @message like "MyTable" 
    | parse @message "*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*" as ts,svrNm,usr,ip,processId,logId,eventType,db,qry
    | stats count(*) as recCnt,earliest(@timestamp) As periodStartMs,latest(@timestamp) As periodEndMs by usr
    | fields fromMillis(periodStartMs) As periodStartTs,fromMillis(periodEndMs) As periodEndTs
    | display usr,periodStartTs,periodEndTs,recCnt
    | sort usr
   2. Get table reference detail
     xxx:fill in
