Get Time Between Procedure Executions
Pre-Conditions:
  -Can only do this if you know one procedure always follows another and only starts after the first one completes
  -Replace "MyProcPart" with a prefix or suffix of all the procedures you want to catch with this query
  -Replace MyProc1 and MyProc2 with proc names
Main Success Scenario:
  1. see code below
    fields @message,@timestamp
    | filter @message like ",QUERY," 
    | filter @message like "MyProcPart"
    | filter @message not like "'CREATE DEFINER=`"
    | filter @message not like "'Drop Procedure "
    | filter @message not like "'SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE `"
    | filter @message not like "SET @_"
    | parse @message /(?<@prc1>(MyProc1))/
    | parse @message /(?<@prc2>(MyProc2))/
    | field Concat(@prc1,@prc2) As prc0
    | filter prc0 like /(?i)(MyProc1|MyProc2)/
    | field "MyProc1" As prc
    | parse @message "*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*" as ts0,svrNm,usr,ip,processId,logId,eventType,db,qry
    | stats earliest(@timestamp) As periodStartMs,latest(@timestamp) As periodEndMs by db,prc
    | fields fromMillis(periodStartMs) As periodStartTs,fromMillis(periodEndMs) As periodEndTs
    | field (periodEndMs - periodStartMs)/1000 As runS
    | field runS/60 As runMn
    | display db,prc,periodStartTs,periodEndTs,runS,runMn # periodEndTs is later than it should be
    | sort periodStartTs
