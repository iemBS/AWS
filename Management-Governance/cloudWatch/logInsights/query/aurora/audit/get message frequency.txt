Get Message Frequency
Note:
  -The query is so general it can be used on other logs as well.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See query below
  
    fields @message,@timestamp
    | field SHIFT * 60 * 60 * 1000 As ShiftHrsInMs # Set "SHIFT" variable, for Pacific it is -7 or -8
    | field toMillis(@timestamp) As utcTimestampInMs
    | field fromMillis(@timestamp) as utcTimestamp
    | field fromMillis(utcTimestampInMs + ShiftHrsInMs) As localTimestamp
    | fields FROM as utcFltrRangeStart,TO as utcFltrRangeEnd # Set "FROM" and "TO" to millisecond values of the the time range filters
    | stats 
      ((max(utcTimestampInMs) - min(utcTimestampInMs))/1000) / count(utcTimestampInMs) as avgMsgFreqInSeconds,
      min(fromMillis(utcFltrRangeStart)) as filterRangeStart,
      min(utcTimestamp) as dataRangeStart,
      min(utcTimestampInMs) - min(utcFltrRangeStart) as filterToDataRangeStartDiffInMs,
