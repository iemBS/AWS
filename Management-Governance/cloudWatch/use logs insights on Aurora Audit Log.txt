Main Success Scenario:
  1. See query below (commented out limit because it is good to have to set a limit, combined object & return code because of parsing issue)
  
    # @timestamp is unix timestamp in microseconds
    fields @timestamp as EntryTm, @message
    | parse "*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*" as TimeStamp, ServerHost, UserName, UserHost, ConnectionId, QueryId, Operation, Database, ObjectAndReturnCode
    | filter Database = "MyDB" and Operation = "QUERY" and UserName = "admin" 
    #| limit 100
    | sort QueryId
    | display EntryTm,QueryId,UserHost,ConnectionId,Operation,Database,ObjectAndReturnCodeMy
