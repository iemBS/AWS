  -Guidance @ https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
  -Guidance @ https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-find-bucket-cost/
  -Guidance @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketBilling.html
  -Billed for data transfer out of S3 and not for the data transfer you receive at the destination
  -Amazon S3 storage usage is calculated in binary gigabytes (GB), where 1GB is 230 bytes. This unit of measurement is also known as a gibibyte (GiB), defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Similarly, 1TB is 240 bytes, i.e. 1024 GBs.
  -Tax Impact: https://aws.amazon.com/c-tax-faqs/
  -S3 has no min fee
  -Use simple monthly calculator
  -Free Tier: https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc
Main Success Scenario:
   1.Minimize amount of data hosted
   2.Make file access predictable
   3."Reduce # of access times"
   4."Minimize distance between accessors and S3"
   5.Choose output data to go to another AWS services instead of the internet
   6.Check for Tax impact
   7.See if the Free Tier can be used
   8."Minimize S3 Features"
   9."Minimize use of other AWS services on your S3 objects"
   10.Avoid renaming folders


Minimize distance between accessors and S3
Main Success Scenario:
  1.Find geo location of source data
  2.Find geo location of the data consumer
  3.Find the AWS region closes to the source and consumer


Minimize S3 Features
Note:
  -Requester Pays bucket = the requester will pay the cost of requests and downloads of your Amazon S3 data
  -Guidance @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html
  -S3 Inventory: The S3 Inventory report provides a scheduled alternative to Amazon S3â€™s synchronous List API.
  -Does use of S3 Dual Stack Endpoints cost? https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/dual-stack-endpoints.html
Main Success Scenario:
   1.Avoid S3 Analytics Storage Class Analysis
   2.Avoid S3 Inventory
   3."Minimize use of S3 Transfer Acceleration"
   4.Avoid S3 Replication
   5."Miniimize S3 Batch Operations"
   6.Choose a lower cost S3 storage class
   7.Enable "Requester Pays bucket" to have other parties pay for downloading
   8.Aviod versioning
   9.Avoid Intelligent-Tiering
   10.Use Lifecycle Management


Minimize use of S3 Transfer Acceleration
Main Success Scenario:
   1.Do not use S3 Transfer Acceleration into S3 if normal source to S3 connection is weaker
   2.Do not use S2 Transfer Acceleration out of S3 if normal S3 to destination connection is weaker
   3.Do not use S3 Transfer Acceleration if you do not need the extra speed


Miniimize S3 Batch Operations
Note:
  -You are charged for S3 Batch Operations jobs, objects, and requests in addition to any charges associated with the operation that S3 Batch Operations performs on your behalf, including data transfer, requests, and other charges.
Main Success Scenario:
  1.Minimize # of jobs you have
  2.Minimize # of object operations performed
   
   
Minimize use of other AWS services on your S3 objects
Note:
  -CloudWatch pricing: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/
  -CloudTrail pricing: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing/
  -S3 Encryption client: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3EncryptionClient.html
  -Key Management Service (KMS): https://aws.amazon.com/kms/
  -Macie: https://aws.amazon.com/macie/
Main Success Scenario:
   1.Avoid object tagging
   2.Avoid using CloudWatch
   3.Avoid using CloudTrail
   4.Avoid using Server-Side Encryption (SSE) and encrypt yourself before uploading to S3
   5.Avoid using S3 Encryption client
   6.Avoid using Key Management Service (KMS) for Encryption keys
   7.Avoid using Macie
   

Reduce # of access times
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Reduce the number of times you access
  2. See if S3 Glacier can be used if accessed infrequent enough.
