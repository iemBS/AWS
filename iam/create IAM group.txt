Create IAM Group
Notes:
  -Guidance @ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html
  -Add users to or remove them from a group.
  -A user can belong to multiple groups.
  -Groups cannot belong to other groups.
  -Groups can be granted permissions using access control policies. This makes it easier to manage permissions for a collection of users, rather than having to manage permissions for each individual user.
  -Groups do not have security credentials, and cannot access web services directly; they exist solely to make it easier to manage user permissions. 
Main Success Scenario:
 1.xxx:fill in
