  -If a predicate in the WHERE clause references columns of a table participating in an outer join in the FROM clause, the filter operates on the rows returned from the join (which might be padded with NULLs).
Main Success Scenario:
  1. see below
    -from (includes joins)
    -where
    -group by
    -having
    -window
    -qualify
    -distinct
    -order by
    -limit
