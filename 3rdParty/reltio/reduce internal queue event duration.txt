Pre-Condition:
  -Task is my term for doing something in Reltio
Main success scenario:
  1. Run more tasks in serial rather than in parallel
  2. "Reduce Internal Queue Event Duration for Inserts/Creations"
  3. end
Alternatives:
  1a. Cannot use more time and run the tasks in serial
    1a1. Scale the tentant up so more events can be processed per minute
    1a2. go to step 2
  2a. focus on deletions instead 
    2a1. "Reduce Internal Queue Event Duration for Deletions"
    2a2. go to step 3
  2b. focus on updates instead 
    2a1. "Reduce Internal Queue Event Duration for Updates"
    2a2. go to step 3

    
Reduce Internal Queue Event Duration for Inserts/Creates
Main success scenario:
  1. "Disable Match and Merge during Bulk Task"
  2. "Disable Auto Indexing during Bulk Task"
  3. "Disable Access during Bulk Task"
    
    
Reduce Internal Queue Event Duration for Deletes
Note:
  -Deletes are less intense than an insert or update
Question:
  -Does disabling auto re-indexing during bulk deletion cause incorrect data to be returned to consumers?
  -Does disabling match and merge during bulk deletion cause incorrect data to be returned to consumers?
Main success scenario:
  1. If possible, do a higher percentage of deletes when there is a higher count of tasks 
  2. "Disable Match and Merge during Bulk Task"
  3. "Disable Auto Indexing during Bulk Task"
  4. "Disable Access during Bulk Task"
  
  
Reduce Internal Queue Event Duration for Updates
Main success scenario:
  1. "Disable Match and Merge during Bulk Task"
  2. "Disable Auto Indexing during Bulk Task"
  3. "Disable Access during Bulk Task"
  
  
Disable Match and Merge during Bulk Task
Note:
  -Having Match and Merge disabled when data is pulled from Reltio can result in data that is missing updates for the consumer
Pre-Condition:
  -Less problematic performance improvements are not good enough
  -Duration of bulk task is acceptable
  -Schedule for bulk task is acceptable 
  -Consumers ok with seeing matched and merged results later
Main success scenario:
  1. Only inserts are done during bulk task
  2. xxx:fill in 
Alternatives:
  1a. Only deletes are done during bulk task
    1a1. xxx:fill in 
  1b. Only updates are done during bulk task
    1b1. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Disable Auto Indexing during Bulk Task
Note:
  -Having Auto Indexing disabled when data is pulled from Reltio can result in bad data for the consumer
Pre-Condition:
  -Less problematic performance improvements are not good enough
  -Duration of bulk task is acceptable
  -Schedule for bulk task is acceptable 
Main success scenario:
  1. Only inserts are done during bulk task
  2. xxx:fill in 
Alternatives:
  1a. Only deletes are done during bulk task
    1a1. xxx:fill in 
  1b. Only updates are done during bulk task
    1b1. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Disable Access during Bulk Task
Pre-Condition:
  -schedule for disabled access is acceptable 
  -disabling access prevents incorrect data for consumers when ...
    -auto indexing is disabled
    -auto match and merge is disabled 
Main success scenario:
  1. Only inserts are done during bulk task
  2. xxx:fill in 
Alternatives:
  1a. Only deletes are done during bulk task
    1a1. xxx:fill in 
  1b. Only updates are done during bulk task
    1b1. xxx:fill in
