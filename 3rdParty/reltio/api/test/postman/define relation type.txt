Define Relation Type
Note:
  -Each relation type is added to "relationTypes"
  -"startObject" and "endObject" note the entities that are being connected
  -"attributes" notes the attributes assoicated to the relation type
  -What is "implicit" for?
  -"direction" notes the direction of the relationship. What does a value of "directed" mean for this attribute?
