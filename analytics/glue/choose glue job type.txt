See Suggested Conditions by Glue Job Type
Note:
  -Python Shell type glue jobs are pre-loaded with these libraries: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-job-python.html#python-shell-supported-library
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See spark type suggeted conditions
       -when you want to scale horizontally, vertically, or both
       -when fine grain control is needed
  2. See spark streaming type suggested conditions
       -xxx:fill in
  3. See python shell type suggested conditions
      -when you DO NOT need much compute power
      -when you want to do less development
      
      
 See Example Uses by Glue Job Type
 Main Success Scenario:
  1. See spark type example uses
  2. See spark streaming type example uses
  3. See python shell type exampmle uses
       -submit SQL query to redshift, Athena, or EMR
